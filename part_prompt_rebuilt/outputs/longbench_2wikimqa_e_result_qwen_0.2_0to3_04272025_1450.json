He left three sons:\n\nHermann III, Vogt of Deutz in St. Severin (Cologne) und Werden (died 1056);\nAdolf II of Lotharingia, count of Keldachgau, Vogt of Deutz (born 1002, died 1041);\nErenfried, Probst of St. Severin.\nPassage 2:\nHenry of Laach\nHenry of Laach (in German: Heinrich von Laach) was the first count palatine of the Rhine (1085/1087\u20131095). Henry was the son of Herman I, count of Gleiberg. Henry was a follower of Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. He had lands in the southeastern Eifel and on the Moselle River.\nMost of the holdings of Hermann II, Count Palatine fell back to the emperor, when Hermann died without successor. The emperor named Henry count palatine of the Rhine and during the emperor's trip to Italy tasked Henry to hold interim judicial councils. Henry married Herman's widow, Adelaide of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde (d. 1100). From this marriage, Henry may have taken control over some of her holdings along the Moselle. As a consequence, the geographic center of the palatinate moved towards the south.\nWith his wife, Adelaide, Henry founded the Maria Laach Abbey. He was succeeded by his stepson, Siegfried of Ballenstedt.\nPassage 3:\nHermann II, Count Palatine of Lotharingia\nHermann II (born 1049; died Dalhem, 20 September 1085), Count Palatine of Lotharingia 1064\u20131085. He was count in the Ruhrgau and the Zulpichgau, as well as a count of Brabant.\n\nLife\nAccording to Egon Kimpen he was the son of Henry I of Lotharingia (\u2020 1061) and Mathild of Verdun (\u2020 1060), daughter of Gozelo I of Lotharingia, but the basis for this has been questioned. However, if that is the case, his maternal uncle was Pope Stephen IX. Until 1064, young Hermann was under the guardianship of Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne, who significantly reduced Hermann's territorial power.\nIn 1080 he married Adelaide of Weimar-Orlam\u00fcnde (\u2020 1100), widow of Adalbert II, Count of Ballenstedt. She was a daughter of Otto of Orlam\u00fcnde, count of Weimar and margrave of Meissen in Thuringia, and Adela of Brabant. Together they had two children who had died by 1085.\nHe is assumed to have been the last Count Palatine of Lotharingia of the Ezzonian dynasty. He was killed in a duel with Albert III, Count of Namur, near his castle in Dalhem. \nHis widow married again, her third husband being Henry of Laach, count in the Mayfeldgau, who became the first count palatine of the Rhine between 1085 and 1087.\nPassage 4:\nJohn Christian, Count Palatine of Sulzbach\nJohn Christian (23 January 1700 \u2013 20 July 1733; in German: Johann Christian Joseph) was the Count Palatine of Sulzbach from 1732\u201333. He was the second and youngest surviving son of duke Theodore Eustace, Count Palatine of Sulzbach (1659\u20131732) with his consort Eleonore Maria Amalia of Hesse-Rotenburg (1675\u20131720). His elder brother was Joseph Charles, Count Palatine of Sulzbach.\n\nLife\nAfter the death of his elder brother Joseph Charles, John Christian Joseph became the eventual designated heir of the Electoral Palatine. In 1732 he succeeded his father as Count Palatine of Sulzbach, but died in Sulzbach in 1733 before inheriting the Palatinate.\nCharles III Philip, Elector Palatine, a member of the Palatine Neuburg line of Wittelsbach failed to produce a legitimate male heir, and his brothers also. By 1716 it was evident that the Neuburg line would become extinct and that the Sulzbach branch would succeed them.\n\nMarriage\nHe married twice:\n\nMarie Anne Henri\u00ebtte Leopoldine de La Tour d'Auvergne (24 October 1708 \u2013 28 July 1728), daughter of Francois Egon de la Tour d'Auvergne, Prince of Auvergne, and had the following children:Charles Theodore (11 December 1724 \u2013 16 February 1799); became Elector Palatine in 1742, and Elector of Bavaria in 1777\nMaria Anne (30 May 1728 \u2013 25 June 1728)Eleonore Philippina Christina Sophia of Hesse-Rotenburg  (1712-1759); married on 1731 but had no issue.\n\n\n== Ancestry ==\nPassage 5:\nPhilip William August, Count Palatine of Neuburg\nPhilip William August, Count Palatine of Neuburg (born 19 November 1668 in Neuburg an der Donau; died: 5 April 1693 in Z\u00e1kupy (German: Reichstadt)) was a  Prince and Count Palatine of Neuburg.\n\nLife\nPhilip William August was the 13th from a total of 17 children of Elector Palatine Philip William (1615-1690) from his second marriage to Elisabeth Amalie (1635-1709), a daughter of Landgrave George II of Hesse-Darmstadt.\nHis oldest sister, Eleonor Magdalene married Emperor Leopold I in 1676.  In August 1689, after he had visited his brother in Breslau and his sister in Vienna, Philip William began his Grand Tour to Italy.\nPhilip William August chose a secular career and entered into active military service.  He died at the age of 24 after suffering for seven days from a \"malignant fever\" and was buried in the parish church of Z\u00e1kupy.  His heart lies in the Court Church in Neuburg on the Danube.\n\nMarriage and issue\nHe married on 29 October 1690 in Raudnitz Anna Maria Franziska (1672\u20131741), a daughter of Duke Julius Francis of Saxe-Lauenburg.  The wedding ceremony, which had to be postponed due to the illness and death of Philip William August's father, was carried out \"plainly\".  His marriage brought Philipp Wilhelm August the following children:\n\nLeopoldine Eleanor (1691\u20131693).\nMaria Anna Carolina (1693\u20131751), married in 1719 Prince Ferdinand of Bavaria (1699\u20131738).\n\nAncestry\nPassage 6:\nHenry I, Count Palatine of Lotharingia\nHenry I (German: Heinrich; d.1061), was Count Palatine of Lotharingia from 1045 until 1060. He was the son of Hezzelin I, Count in Z\u00fclpichgau, and a member of the Ezzonid dynasty. Historians have given several nicknames to Heinrich: Furiosus (the Violent/the Insane), because he murdered his wife, and Monachus (the Monk), because he was confined into an abbey to treat his insanity.\n\nLife\nHenry was the son of Hezzelin I and his unnamed wife, who was probably a daughter of  Conrad I of Carinthia.Around 1048 Henry married Mathilda of Verdun (born abt 1025, died 27 July 1060), daughter of Duke Gozelo of Lotharingia, and sister of pope Stephen IX.\nHe received the Mosellan castle of Cochem from his niece, Queen Richeza of Poland. He was elected as successor for the German kingdom during Emperor Henry III's illness.\nShortly after 1058, Henry began to show signs of insanity, for which he was confined to the abbey of Gorze. He escaped however, and thinking that his wife Matilda had been unfaithful to him, he killed her (27 July 1060). Henry then was definitely enclosed into the abbey of Echternach, where he died in 1061. His office and counties were confiscated by Anno II, archbishop of Cologne, who became the guardian of their only son, the later count palatine Hermann II (1064-1085).\nPassage 7:\nRudolph II, Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen\nRudolph II, Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen (died 1 November 1247) was Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen and Vogt of Sindelfingen.  He was the younger son of Rudolph I and his wife Matilda of Gleiberg, heiress of Giessen.\n\nLife\nRudolph II inherited the County Palatine of T\u00fcbingen when his elder brother Hugo III died in 1216.  From 1224 onwards, he is described as Count Palatine in many imperial documents, while his younger brother William is merely styled as Count.  Rudolph II supported Bebenhausen Abbey, which his parents had founded. \nNext to his father, Rudolph II is the second most mentioned Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen in imperial documents, mostly in documents by King Henry (VII) of Germany, the son of Emperor Frederick II, who had been elected King of Germany in 1220, at the age of 8.  Frederick II spent much of his time in Italy, leaving his ancestral Swabia in the hands of his son.  Later, in 1232, Henry revolted against his father, and did everything in his power to win the Swabian nobility over to his side.  Rudolph II appears to have been among the noblemen who sided with Henry VII, at least, he is mentioned in 10 different documents of Henry VII and never by Frederick II.  Considering Rudolph's energetic character, one can assume that he intended to use the conflict between Henry VII and Frederick II to expand his own power and aim at an independent position.Swabian noblemen, including Rudolph II and his brother William, Count Hartmann I of W\u00fcrttemberg and a Count of Dillingen, visited Henry VII in Worms on 8 January 1224.  They met Margrave Herman V of Baden was also present, as was Eberhard, S\u00e9n\u00e9chal of Waldburg and councillor and former guardian of Henry VII in Oppenheim on 5 April 1227 and in Hagenau on 1 May.  In the same year, Rudolph met Duke Louis I of Bavaria, who was an imperial vicar and Conrad of Winterstetten, who was imperial cup-bearer and also a councilor of Henry VII.  He met the Lords of Neuffen and the imperial marshal Anselm of Justingen in Ulm on 23 February 1228.  On 31 August 1228, Rudolph II appears, together with Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Henry of Wirtemberg, a Count of Dillingen, Conrad of Weinsperg and the councillors mentioned above, as witnesses of a deed in which King henry VII confirms the privileges of Adelber Abbey in Esslingen.  Later that year, Rudolph II appeared as a witness in four deed by Duke Louis I of Bavaria and Bishop Ekbert of Bamberg, together with, among others, Margrave Herman V of Baden, Count Ulrich and Eberhard of Helfenstein, Counts Eberhard and Otto of Eberstein, Count Gottfried of Hohenlohe, and two councilors.Rudolph II stood at the head of a delegation of eight Swabian counts, among them Albert IV of Habsburg, Frederick IV of Zollern and a Count of Eberstein, at the Imperial Diet in Worms on 29 April 1231.  On 22 November 1231, Rudolph II and his brother William met Counts Albert of Rottenburg, Ulrich of Hefenstein and Eberhard of Walpurg at Henry VII's castle in Ulm.  On 31 December 1231, Rudolph witnessed a deed benefiting Neresheim Abbey in Wimpfen, together with Duke Conrad I of Teck and Margrave Hermann V of Baden.  The last time Rudolph II witnessed a deed of Henry VII was on 4 June 1233 in Esslingen, again with his brother William.In 1235, Pope Gregory IX called on the princes of the empire to organize a new crusade into the Holy Land, to render assistance to the beleaguered church there.  Rudolph II is the only Swabian nobleman named in this call to arms; whether he actually went to the Holy Land is unknown.  The fact that he is not mentioned in any deed between 1235 and 1243 suggests that he may have been absent for an extended period.  In particular, no mention is made of his position in the struggle between King Conrad IV of Germany and anti-King Henry Raspe IV, which is remarkable, since this struggle took place mainly in Swabia.  However, a deed in favour of Bebenhausen Abbey which the papal legate made at Rudolph II's request in the army camp outside Ulm on 28 January 1247, suggests that he supported Henry Raspe.\n\nFamily\nThe name of Rudolph II's wife has not been preserved.  She was a daughter of a Margrave Henry from the House of Ronsberg and Udilhild of Gammertingen. They had the following children:\n\nHugo IV, Count Palatine of T\u00fcbingen\nRudolf III of Scheer (d. 12 May 1277), Count of T\u00fcbingen-Herrenberg\nUlrich\nMathilda, married Burchard II, Count of Hohenberg (d. 14 July 1253, struck by lightning).  Their daughter Gertrude Anna (c.\u20091225 \u2013 16 February 1281) married Emperor Rudolf I, the first Emperor from the House of Habsburg.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\nPassage 8:\nReichard, Count Palatine of Simmern-Sponheim\nReichard (25 July 1521 \u2013 13 January 1598) was the Count Palatine of Simmern-Sponheim from 1569 until 1598.\nReichard was born in Simmern in 1521 to Johann II, Count Palatine of Simmern. In 1569 he succeeded his brother Georg as Count Palatine of Simmern-Sponheim. Reichard died in Simmern in 1598. Without any surviving children, Simmern-Sponheim was inherited by his great-nephew Frederick IV.\n\nMarriage\nReichard married Juliane of Wied (c. 1545 - 30 April 1575, daughter of Count Johann IV of Wied, on 30 July 1569 and had several children:\n\nJuliana (21 November 1571 \u2013 4 February 1592)\nKatherine (10 May 1573 \u2013 12 October 1576)\nunnamed son (1574)\nunnamed son (30 April 1575)Reichard married Emilie of W\u00fcrttemberg (19 August 1550 - 4 June 1589), daughter of Christoph, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, on 26 March 1578.\nReichard married Anne Margaret of Palatinate-Veldenz (17 January 1571 - 1 November 1621), daughter of Count Palatine Georg Johann I, on 14 December 1589.\nPassage 9:\nSabina, Duchess of Bavaria\nSabina, Duchess of Bavaria (1528\u20131578) was the daughter of John II, Count Palatine of Simmern and Beatrix of Baden.\n\nMarriage\nIn 1544 she married Lamoral, Count of Egmont with whom she had twelve children. When her husband was arrested and accused of treason in 1567, she wrote king Philip II, the king of Spain, a letter to plead for his release. It was to no avail and he was decapitated in the following year. Sabina was buried in Egmont's crypt in Zottegem.\n\nChildren\nCharles, 7th Count of Egmont, Prince de Gavre: married to Marie de Lens,  Lady of Aubigny.\n\nWidowhood\nAfter her death in 1578, she was buried next to her husband in Zottegem.\nPassage 10:\nOtto I, Count Palatine of Mosbach\nOtto I (24 August 1390 \u2013 5 July 1461) was the Count Palatine of Mosbach from 1410 until 1448, and the Count Palatine of Mosbach-Neumarkt from 1448 until 1461.\n\nLife\nOtto was born in Mosbach in 1390 as the youngest son of Rupert III of the Palatinate, King of Germany. In 1410 after the death of his father, the territories of the Palatinate were divided between his four sons; Otto received the territory around Mosbach and Eberbach. He made Mosbach his capital and began the construction of a new residence there. Otto became the regent of the Electorate of the Palatinate and guardian of his nephew Louis IV after his brother Louis III returned from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem seriously ill and died soon after. He held the regency until 1442.\nIn 1448 he inherited half of the territory of the extinct Palatinate-Neumarkt line and purchased the other half from his brother Stephen, and he also established a residence in Neumarkt. Otto died in Reichenbach in 1461 and was buried in the Benedictine Reichenbach Abbey.\n\nMarriage\nOtto married Joanna of Bavaria-Landshut (1413 - 20 July 1444), daughter of duke Henry XVI in January 1430 and had the following children:\n\nMargaret (2 March 1432 - 14 September 1457)\nAmalie (22 February 1433 - 5 December 1488)\nOtto (26 June 1435 - 8 April 1499)\nRupert (25 November 1437 - 1 November 1465)\nDorothea (24 August 1439 - 15 May 1482) Prioress in the Liebenau monastery\nAlbert (6 September 1440 -  20 August 1506)\nAnne (1441 - ?)

        "context": "Passage 1:\nBrian Kennedy (gallery director)\nBrian Patrick Kennedy (born 5 November 1961) is an Irish-born art museum director who has worked in Ireland and Australia, and now lives and works in the United States.  He was the director of the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem for 17 months, resigning December 31, 2020. He was the director of the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio from 2010 to 2019. He was the director of the Hood Museum of Art from 2005 to 2010, and the National Gallery of Australia (Canberra) from 1997 to 2004.\n\nCareer\nBrian Kennedy currently lives and works in the United States after leaving Australia in 2005 to direct the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College. In October 2010 he became the ninth Director of the Toledo Museum of Art. On 1 July 2019, he succeeded Dan Monroe as the executive director and CEO of the Peabody Essex Museum.\n\nEarly life and career in Ireland\nKennedy was born in Dublin and attended Clonkeen College. He received B.A. (1982), M.A. (1985) and PhD (1989) degrees from University College-Dublin, where he studied both art history and history.\nHe worked in the Irish Department of Education (1982), the European Commission, Brussels (1983), and in Ireland at the Chester Beatty Library (1983\u201385), Government Publications Office (1985\u201386), and Department of Finance (1986\u201389). He married Mary Fiona Carlin in 1988.He was Assistant Director at the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin from 1989 to 1997. He was Chair of the Irish Association of Art Historians from 1996 to 1997, and of the Council of Australian Art Museum Directors from 2001 to 2003. In September 1997 he became Director of the National Gallery of Australia.\n\nNational Gallery of Australia (NGA)\nKennedy expanded the traveling exhibitions and loans program throughout Australia, arranged for several major shows of Australian art abroad, increased the number of exhibitions at the museum itself and oversaw the development of an extensive multi-media site.  Although he oversaw several years of the museum's highest ever annual visitation, he discontinued the emphasis of his predecessor, Betty Churcher, on showing \"blockbuster\" exhibitions.\nDuring his directorship, the NGA gained government support for improving the building and significant private donations and corporate sponsorship. However, the initial design for the building proved controversial generating a public dispute with the original architect on moral rights grounds.  As a result, the project was not delivered during Dr Kennedy's tenure, with a significantly altered design completed some years later.  Private funding supported two acquisitions of British art, including David Hockney's A Bigger Grand Canyon in 1999, and Lucian Freud's After C\u00e9zanne in 2001. Kennedy built on the established collections at the museum by acquiring the Holmgren-Spertus collection of Indonesian textiles; the Kenneth Tyler collection of editioned prints, screens, multiples and unique proofs; and the Australian Print Workshop Archive. He was also notable for campaigning for the construction of a new \"front\" entrance to the Gallery, facing King Edward Terrace, which was completed in 2010 (see reference to the building project above).\nKennedy's cancellation of the \"Sensation exhibition\" (scheduled at the NGA from 2 June 2000 to 13 August 2000) was controversial, and seen by some as censorship. He claimed that the decision was due to the exhibition being \"too close to the market\" implying that a national cultural institution cannot exhibit the private collection of a speculative art investor. However, there were other exhibitions at the NGA during his tenure, which could have raised similar concerns. The exhibition featured the privately owned Young British Artists works belonging to Charles Saatchi and attracted large attendances in London and Brooklyn. Its most controversial work was Chris Ofili's The Holy Virgin Mary, a painting which used elephant dung and was accused of being blasphemous. The then-mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, campaigned against the exhibition, claiming it was \"Catholic-bashing\" and an \"aggressive, vicious, disgusting attack on religion.\" In November 1999, Kennedy cancelled the exhibition and stated that the events in New York had \"obscured discussion of the artistic merit of the works of art\". He has said that it \"was the toughest decision of my professional life, so far.\"Kennedy was also repeatedly questioned on his management of a range of issues during the Australian Government's Senate Estimates process - particularly on the NGA's occupational health and safety record and concerns about the NGA's twenty-year-old air-conditioning system. The air-conditioning was finally renovated in 2003. Kennedy announced in 2002 that he would not seek extension of his contract beyond 2004, accepting a seven-year term as had his two predecessors.He became a joint Irish-Australian citizen in 2003.\n\nToledo Museum of Art\nThe Toledo Museum of Art is known for its exceptional collections of European and American paintings and sculpture, glass, antiquities, artist books, Japanese prints and netsuke. The museum offers free admission and is recognized for its historical leadership in the field of art education.  During his tenure, Kennedy has focused the museum's art education efforts on visual literacy, which he defines as \"learning to read, understand and write visual language.\"   Initiatives have included baby and toddler tours, specialized training for all staff, docents, volunteers and the launch of a website, www.vislit.org. In November 2014, the museum hosted the International Visual Literacy Association (IVLA) conference, the first Museum to do so. Kennedy has been a frequent speaker on the topic, including 2010 and 2013 TEDx talks on visual and sensory literacy.\nKennedy has expressed an interest in expanding the museum's collection of contemporary art and art by indigenous peoples. Works by Frank Stella, Sean Scully, Jaume Plensa, Ravinder Reddy and Mary Sibande have been acquired.  In addition, the museum has made major acquisitions of Old Master paintings by Frans Hals and Luca Giordano.During his tenure the Toledo Museum of Art has announced the return of several objects from its collection due to claims the objects were stolen and/or illegally exported prior being sold to the museum.  In 2011 a Meissen sweetmeat stand was returned to Germany followed by an Etruscan Kalpis or water jug to Italy (2013), an Indian sculpture of Ganesha (2014) and an astrological compendium to Germany in 2015.\n\nHood Museum of Art\nKennedy became Director of the Hood Museum of Art in July 2005. During his tenure, he implemented a series of large and small-scale exhibitions and oversaw the production of more than 20 publications to bring greater public attention to the museum's remarkable collections of the arts of America, Europe, Africa, Papua New Guinea and the Polar regions. At 70,000 objects, the Hood has one of the largest collections on any American college of university campus. The exhibition, Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body, toured several US venues. Kennedy increased campus curricular use of works of art, with thousands of objects pulled from storage for classes annually. Numerous acquisitions were made with the museum's generous endowments, and he curated several exhibitions: including Wenda Gu: Forest of Stone Steles: Retranslation and Rewriting Tang Dynasty Poetry, Sean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, and Frank Stella: Irregular Polygons.\n\nPublications\nKennedy has written or edited a number of books on art, including:\n\nAlfred Chester Beatty and Ireland 1950-1968: A study in cultural politics, Glendale Press (1988), ISBN 978-0-907606-49-9\nDreams and responsibilities: The state and arts in independent Ireland, Arts Council of Ireland (1990), ISBN 978-0-906627-32-7\nJack B Yeats: Jack Butler Yeats, 1871-1957 (Lives of Irish Artists), Unipub (October 1991), ISBN 978-0-948524-24-0\nThe Anatomy Lesson: Art and Medicine (with Davis Coakley), National Gallery of Ireland (January 1992), ISBN 978-0-903162-65-4\nIreland: Art into History (with Raymond Gillespie), Roberts Rinehart Publishers (1994), ISBN 978-1-57098-005-3\nIrish Painting, Roberts Rinehart Publishers (November 1997),  ISBN 978-1-86059-059-7\nSean Scully: The Art of the Stripe, Hood Museum of Art (October 2008), ISBN 978-0-944722-34-3\nFrank Stella: Irregular Polygons, 1965-1966, Hood Museum of Art (October 2010), ISBN 978-0-944722-39-8\n\nHonors and achievements\nKennedy was awarded the Australian Centenary Medal in 2001 for service to Australian Society and its art. He is a trustee and treasurer of the Association of Art Museum Directors, a peer reviewer for the American Association of Museums and a member of the International Association of Art Critics. In 2013 he was appointed inaugural eminent professor at the University of Toledo and received an honorary doctorate from Lourdes University. Most recently, Kennedy received the 2014 Northwest Region, Ohio Art Education Association award for distinguished educator for art education.\n\n\n== Notes ==\nPassage 2:\nOlav Aaraas\nOlav Aaraas (born 10 July 1950) is a Norwegian historian and museum director.\nHe was born in Fredrikstad.

He competed in the men's tournament at the 2004 Summer Olympics.\nPassage 3:\nMaria al-Qibtiyya\nM\u0101riyya bint Sham\u02bf\u016bn (Arabic: \u0645\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u0629 \u0628\u0646\u062a \u0634\u0645\u0639\u0648\u0646), better known as M\u0101riyyah al-Qib\u1e6diyyah or al-Qub\u1e6diyya (Arabic: \u0645\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u0637\u064a\u0629), or Maria the Copt, died 637, was an Egyptian woman who, along with her sister Sirin bint Shamun, was sent to the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 628 as a gift by Al-Muqawqis, a Christian governor of Alexandria, during the territory's Sasanian occupation. She and her sister were slaves. She spent the rest of her life in Medina and had a son, Ibrahim with Muhammad. The son died as an infant and she died almost five years later.Al-Maqrizi says that she was a native of Hebenu (Coptic: \u2ca1\u2c99\u2c81\u2c9b\u03e9\u2c81\u2c83\u2c93\u2c9b, Koin\u0113 Greek: \u1f08\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2 Al\u00e1bastr\u014dn p\u00f3lis, Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0641\u0646, romanized: al-Khafn), a village located near Antino\u00f6polis.\n\nBiography\nIn the Islamic year 6 AH (627 \u2013 628 CE), Muhammad is said to have had letters written to the great rulers of the Middle East, proclaiming the continuation of the monotheistic faith with its final messages and inviting the rulers to join. The purported texts of some of the letters are found in Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings. Tabari writes that a deputation was sent to an Egyptian governor named as al-Muqawqis. Maria was a slave who was offered as a gift of goodwill to Muhammad in reply to his envoys inviting the governor of Alexandria to Islam. Muhammad emancipated her after the birth of her son.\nTabari recounts the story of Maria's arrival from Egypt:\n\nIn this year H\u0101tib b. Abi Balta'ah came back from al-Muqawqis bringing M\u0101riyah and her sister S\u012br\u012bn, his female mule Duldul, his donkey Ya'f\u016br, and sets of garments. With the two women al-Muqawqis had sent a eunuch, and the latter stayed with them. H\u0101tib had invited them to become Muslims before he arrived with them, and M\u0101riyah and her sister did so. The Messenger of God, peace and blessings of Allah be upon Him, lodged them with Umm Sulaym bt. Milh\u0101n. M\u0101riyah was beautiful. The prophet sent her sister S\u012br\u012bn to Hass\u0101n b. Th\u0101bit and she bore him 'Abd al-Rahm\u0101n b. Hass\u0101n.\nThe death of Ibrahim caused Muhammad to weep.\n\nStatus as a wife or concubine\nMuhammad's earliest biographers, like Ibn Ishaq, Ibn Sa\u2019d, and al-Tabari, mentioned Mariyah as the Prophet\u2019s slavegirl or concubine in their sirah.Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya is another scholar and biographer of prophet Muhammad who writes a sirah called Zad al-Ma'ad where he mentioned Mariyah as a slave girl.Like Rayhana bint Zayd, there is some debate between historians and scholars as to whether Mariyah ever became Muhammad's wife or remained a concubine. An indication that she was a concubine is that when she bore her son to Muhammad, she was set free.\nIbn \u2018Abbas said: When Maria gave birth to Ibrahim the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) said, \u2018Her son has set her free.\u2019  There is also strong evidence that there was no living quarter for her in the proximity of the Prophet's Mosque. Only the wives of Muhammad had their quarters adjacent to one another in the proximity of his mosque at Medina. Maria was made to reside permanently in an orchard, some three kilometers from the mosque. Evidence that suggests she was a concubine is in the narration:\nAnas said:  The Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) had a female-slave (amat) with whom he had intercourse, but \u2018Aishah and Hafsah would not leave him alone until he said that she was forbidden for him. Then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed: \u201cO Prophet! Why do you forbid (for yourself) that which Allah has allowed to you.\u2019 until the end of the Verse.\u201d\nThe \u2018female-slave\u2019 referred to in this narration was Maria, the Copt, as specified in a hadith attributed to Umar and classified as sahih by Ibn Kathir, which names her Umm Ibrahim (the mother of Ibrahim).In a report from Ibn \u2018Abbas and \u2018Urwah b. al-Zubair concerning the same incident, Muhammad said to Hafsa:\n\nI make you witness that I my concubine (surriyyati) is now forbidden unto me.\nSome Islamic scholars point to a different Asb\u0101b al-nuz\u016bl (circumstance of revelation) for the above incident, saying it was only caused by Muhammad drinking honey, as narrated in Sahih al-Bukhari by Muhammed's wife Aisha:\nThe Prophet (\ufdfa) used to stay (for a period) in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh (one of the wives of the Prophet ) and he used to drink honey in her house. Hafsa bint Umar and I decided that when the Prophet (\ufdfa) entered upon either of us, she would say, \"I smell in you the bad smell of Maghafir (a bad smelling raisin). Have you eaten Maghafir?\" When he entered upon one of us, she said that to him. He replied (to her), \"No, but I have drunk honey in the house of Zaynab bint Jahsh, and I will never drink it again.\"\nHowever, another narration in Sunan Abu Dawud indicates that drinking honey is a euphemism for sexual intercourse:\n\nThe Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) was asked about a man who divorced his wife three times, and she married another who entered upon her, but divorced her before having intercourse with her, whether she was lawful for the former husband. She said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) replied: She is not lawful for the first (husband) until she tastes the honey of the other husband and he tastes her honey.\nAl-Tabari lists Maria as both one of Muhammad's wives and his slave, perhaps using \"wife\" in the sense of one whom Muhammad slept with and who mothered his child.\nMariyah the Copt was presented to the Messenger of God, given to him by al-Muqawqis, the ruler of Alexandria, and she gave birth to the Messenger of God\u2019s son Ibrahim. These were the Messenger of God's wifes.\nThe Prophet admired Umm Ibrahim [\"Mother of Ibrahim,\" Mariyah\u2019s title], who was fair-skinned and beautiful. He lodged her in al-\u2018Aliyah, at the property nowadays called of Umm Ibrahim. He used to visit her there and ordered her to veil herself, [but] he had intercourse with her by virtue of her being his property...\nOne hadith attributed to Mus\u2018ab b. \u2018Abdullah al-Zubairi states that the two were married, though another rendering of the hadith by Mus\u2018ab's nephew Zubair b. al-Bakkar makes no mention of marriage.\n\nSee also\nAisha bint Abu Bakr\nList of non-Arab Sahaba\n\nNotes\nPassage 4:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh  was a leading Salafi scholar in Saudi Arabia and minister of justice between 1975 and 1990.\n\nBackground\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh was born into the noted family of Saudi religious scholars, the Al ash-Sheikh, descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the influential Muslim scholar. He was the eldest son of Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh, Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia until 1969.\n\nCareer\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad was one of the most influential religious leaders in the early 1970s. He maintained a close relationship with King Faisal, with whom he met on a weekly basis. He believed that Saudi Arabia should take a leading role in the Arab world and pushed for Saudi involvement in war with Israel.Between 1975 and 1990, he served as minister of justice.\n\nFamily\nHis brother Abdullah ibn Muhammad Al ash-Sheikh, a younger son of the late Grand Mufti, also served as minister of justice, from 1993 to 2009. His grandson Turki is a lawyer practicing in London and Riyadh.\nPassage 5:\nAbdullah ibn Muhammad\n\u02bfAbd All\u0101h ibn Mu\u1e25ammad (Arabic: \u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0647 \u0671\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f) also known as al-\u1e6c\u0101hir (lit.\u2009'the pure') and al-\u1e6cayyib (lit.\u2009'the good') was one of the sons of Muhammad and Khadija. He died in childhood.\nHis full name was Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Shaiba. His father became a successful merchant and was involved in trade. Due to his upright character Muhammad acquired the nickname \"al-Amin\" (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0646), meaning \"faithful, trustworthy\" and \"al-Sadiq\" meaning \"truthful\" and was sought out as an impartial arbitrator. His reputation attracted a proposal in 595 from Khadija, a successful businesswoman. Muhammad consented to the marriage, which by all accounts was a happy one. After the marriage was consummated, his elder brother al-Qasim was born. Qasim was the eldest son of Muhammad and Khadija. After Qasim, his four sisters were born. Abd Allah was born around 611. He was the youngest child of Muhammad and Khadija.\nMuhammad gave him the name of his father. Abd Allah died at 4 in 615 CE.\n\nSiblings\n\nQasim ibn Muhammad\nZainab bint Muhammad\nRuqayya bint Muhammad\nUmm Kulthum bint Muhammad\nFatima bint Muhammad\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nPassage 6:\nIbrahim ibn Muhammad\nIbr\u0101h\u012bm ibn Mu\u1e25ammad (Arabic: \u0625\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0647\u0650\u064a\u0645 \u0671\u0628\u0652\u0646 \u0645\u064f\u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f), was the son of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and Maria al-Qibtiyya. He died at the age of 2.\n\nEclipse occurrence\nIn his book \"Al-Bid\u0101ya wa-n-Nih\u0101ya\" Ibn Kathir mentions that Ibrahim died on Thursday 10 Rabi' al-Awwal 10 AH, and on the same day right after his death, an eclipse of the sun occurred, so people at the moment started talking that Allah is showing his condolences to his prophet by eclipsing the Sun. Muhammad, not wanting his companions to fall into Fitna by ascribing divinities to him or his son, stood at the mosque and said:  \"The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see the eclipse pray and invoke Allah.\"\n\nIllness and death\nMuhammad's wife, and the mother of believers, Ibrahim's mother was an Egyptian woman who came from Byzantine official to Muhammad in 628. According to Ibn Kathir, quoting Ibn Sa'd, he was born in the last month of the year 8 AH, equivalent of 630 CE. Muslim scholars such as Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj and Al-Nasa'i mention that Al-Waqidi is not reliable and is not trustworthy to be quoted. The child was named after Abraham (or Ibrahim in Arabic) the Biblical prophet revered in Jewish, Christian and Muslim traditions. Ibrahim was placed in the care of a nurse called Umm Sayf, wife of Abu Sayf, the blacksmith, in the tradition of the Arabs of the time, to whom Muhammad gave some goats to complement her milk supply. When he fell ill he was moved to a date orchard near the residence of his mother, under the care of her and her sister Sirin. When it was clear that he would not likely survive, Muhammad was informed. His reaction to the news is reported as:\n\nHe was so shocked at the news that he felt his knees could no longer carry him, and asked `Abd al Rahman ibn `Awf to give him his hand to lean upon. He proceeded immediately to the orchard and arrived in time to bid farewell to an infant dying in his mother's lap. Prophet Muhammad took the child and laid him in his own lap while shaking his hand. His heart was torn apart by the new tragedy, and his face mirrored his inner pain. Choking with sorrow, he said to his son, \"O Ibrahim, against the judgement of God, we cannot avail you a thing,\" and then fell silent. Tears flowed from his eyes. The child lapsed gradually, and his mother and aunt watched and cried incessantly, and the Prophet never ordered them to stop. As Ibrahim surrendered to death, Prophet Muhammad's hope which had consoled him for a brief while completely crumbled. With tears in his eyes he talked once more to the dead child: \"O Ibrahim, were the truth not certain that the last of us will join the first, we would have mourned you even more than we do now.\" A moment later he said: \"The eyes send their tears and the heart is saddened, but we do not say anything except that which pleases our Lord. Indeed, O Ibrahim, we are bereaved by your departure from us.\"\n\nBurial\nMuhammad is also reported as having informed Maria and Sirin that Ibrahim would have his own nurse in Paradise. Different accounts relate that the ghusl for Ibrahim was performed by either Umm Burdah, or al-Fadl ibn \u02bfAbbas, in preparation for burial. Thereafter, he was carried to the cemetery upon a little bier by Muhammad, his uncle al-\u02bfAbbas, and others. Here, after a funeral prayer led by Muhammad, he was interred. Muhammad then filled the grave with sand, sprinkled some water upon it, and placed a landmark on it, saying that \"Tombstones do neither good nor ill, but they help appease the living. Anything that man does, God wishes him to do well.\"\n\nSiblings\nQasim ibn Muhammad\nAbd Allah ibn Muhammad\nZainab bint Muhammad\nRuqayya bint Muhammad\nUmm Kulthum bint Muhammad\nFatimah al-Zahra bint Muhammad\n\nSee also\nIslam and children\nPassage 7:\nIbrahim ibn al-Husayn (Ibn al-Walid)\nIbrahim ibn al-Husayn ibn Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-Walid (Arabic: \u0625\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u064a\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0628\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u064a\u062f, romanized: Ibr\u0101h\u012bm ibn al-\u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Mu\u1e25ammad ibn al-Wal\u012bd) was the eleventh Tayyibi Isma'ili D\u0101\u02bf\u012b al-Mu\u1e6dlaq in Yemen, from 1287 to his death in 1328.\n\nLife\nIbrahim was a member of the Banu al-Walid al-Anf family, that dominated the office of D\u0101\u02bf\u012b al-Mu\u1e6dlaq almost continuously in the 13th to early 16th centuries. He was the son of the eighth D\u0101\u02bf\u012b, Al-Husayn ibn Ali, and brother of the ninth D\u0101\u02bf\u012b, Ali ibn al-Husayn. Ibrahim moved his seat from Sanaa to the fortress of Af'ida, and in 1325 he took over the town of Kawkaban, where he started gathering military forces to oppose the Zaydi imams.He was succeeded by Muhammad ibn Hatim (1327\u20131328), who in turn was succeeded by Ibrahim's son Ali Shams al-Din I.\n\nTomb\nHis grave, along with those of the 12th and 13th D\u0101\u02bf\u012bs, were hidden and unknown until recently, when the archaeological authority of Yemen, along with Dawoodi Bohras living there, located them on Hisn Af'ida. On 25 November 2018, Mufaddal Saifuddin, the 53rd D\u0101\u02bf\u012b al-Mu\u1e6dlaq, unveiled its existence. A mausoleum will soon be made and declared open.\nPassage 8:\nAmir Muhammad (director)\nAmir Muhammad (born 5 December 1972) is a Malaysian writer and independent filmmaker.\n\nLife and career\nHe was born on 5 December 1972 in Kuala Lumpur to civil servant Muhammad Abdullah and housewife Asiah Kechik. He was educated at the University of East Anglia with a degree in Law, though he never did his bar but rather worked in his sponsoring company's legal company for nine months.He had also written for Malaysian print media since the age of 14, notably the New Straits Times, where he had worked there as a part timer under several editors. He had a dedicated column there from 1995 until it was stopped in 1999 during the general elections as the column was considered to be \"unhelpful to the government in its bid to win the elections.\"Amir took up filmmaking on the encouragement of film director U-Wei Haji Saari after interviewing the latter during his part-time job as the latter's film Perempuan, Isteri Dan...? was released in 1993. In 2000, he wrote and directed Malaysia's first DV feature. Some of his works have also been featured in a number of international film festivals including the Sundance Film Festival and the Berlin International Film Festival.

Ridhuan was part of the pioneer batch at the National Football Academy that was set up in 2000.\n\nYoung Lions\nRidhuan started his career with S.League clubs Young Lions. First catching the eye for the national U18 team with his speed and mazy dribbling skills, he joined the Young Lions for the 2003 S.League season.\n\nTampines Rovers\nIn 2007, Tampines Rovers head coach Vorawan Chitavanich offered Ridhuan to play at Tampines Rovers which he accepted.\n\nArema Malang\nIn 2009, Ridhuan was in the midst of discussion with Indonesian club Persib Bandung when fellow national footballer, Noh Alam Shah, invited him to join Arema F.C. Ridhuan eventually signed with Arema and spent three and a half season with Arema and helped Arema to win the 2009-2010 Indonesian Super League title.In 2003, Ridhuan also spent half a season on loan at Putra Samarinda. He was wildly popular during his time in Indonesia and was often referred to as R6, a moniker of Cristiano Ronaldo's CR7.Due to a possible ban by FIFA on football activities in Indonesia, Ridhuan left the club and returned to Singapore.\n\nGeylang International\nWith a FIFA ban looming on all Indonesian footballing activities, he moved back to Singapore with Geylang International after his 4-year sojourn.\n\nTampines Rovers\nFollowing his release by Tampines Rovers at the conclusion of the 2015 S.League season, Ridhuan announced his retirement from football to forge a new career in the oil and gas industry following his failure to secure a contract.\n\nWarriors FC\nHowever, the speedy winger was snapped up by Warriors FC just before the start of the 2016 S.League season and made his debut as a substitute in a 3\u20131 loss against Brunei DPMM. He scored his first goal of the season in a 2\u20132 draw against Geylang International to rescue a point for the Warriors after coming on as a substitute. He repaid the faith that the Warriors had shown him by accumulating a total of four goals and six assists in all competitions. His performances for the Warriors was rewarded with a contract extension for the 2017 S.League season.\n\nBorneo FC\nRidhuan planned to end his footballing career in Indonesia and signed a one month deal with Borneo FC in early 2018 to participate in a tournament. After his contract ended, Warriors FC contacted Ridhuan to sign him back to the club but was rejected by him.\n\nTanjong Pagar United\nOn 13 January 2021, Tanjong Pagar United has announced that they have signed Ridhuan for the 2021 season. This marks him coming out of retirement from football since 2018. On 10 October 2021, Ridhuan retired from football after a season with the Jaguars, making four appearances for the club.\n\nManagerial career\nTanjong Pagar United U15\nOn 28 December 2021, Tanjong Pagar United has announced that Ridhuan will be a part of the coaching team. He will coach the club\u2019s U15 team.\n\nInternational career\nWhile Ridhuan did not feature much in the league, Singapore coach Radojko Avramovi\u0107 saw something in the talented youngster and gave him his international debut against Qatar on 19 November 2003.With midfielder Shahril Ishak, defender Baihakki Khaizan and keeper Hassan Sunny, he is part of the 'NFA Gang of Four', the quartet which has played together since their early teenage years and earned senior international honours in 2003.\nHe was also part of the national side that won the 2004 AFF Championship albeit only featuring in the opening game. Three years later in the 2007 AFF Championship, he played a major role in the team's success in retaining the championship.\nAs of December 2017, Ridhuan has amassed 68 caps for Singapore.\n\nPersonal life\nRidhuan went to Hong Kah Primary and Secondary School. Apart from playing football, he owns a home based barber service called 1E_Xpress. Amongst his clients was his former lions teammates Baihakki Khaizan, Khairul Amri, Noh Alam Shah and Shahril Ishak.\n\nNational team career statistics\nGoals for Senior National Team\nScores and results list Nigeria's goal tally first.\n\nHonours\nClub\nArema IndonesiaIndonesia Super League: 2009\u201310WarriorsSingapore FA Cup: 2017\n\nInternational\nSingaporeAFF Championship: 2004, 2007\nPassage 10:\nMinamoto no Chikako\nMinamoto no Chikako (\u6e90 \u89aa\u5b50) was the daughter of Kitabatake Morochika, and Imperial consort to Emperor Go-Daigo.
