(Associated Press) \n \n Shelly Sterling spoke to Barbara Walters, and ABC News posted a short story with excerpts from the conversation Sunday. \n \n NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has banned Donald Sterling for making racist comments and urged owners to force Sterling to sell the team. Silver added that no decisions had been made about the rest of Sterling's family. \n \n According to ABC's story, Shelly Sterling told Walters: \"I will fight that decision.\" \n \n Sterling also said that she \"eventually\" will divorce her husband, and that she hadn't yet done so due to financial considerations. ||||| Shelly Sterling said today that \"eventually, I am going to\" divorce her estranged husband, Donald Sterling, and if the NBA tries to force her to sell her half of the Los Angeles Clippers, she would \"absolutely\" fight to keep her stake in the team. \n \n \"I will fight that decision,\" she told ABC News' Barbara Walters today in an exclusive interview. \"To be honest with you, I'm wondering if a wife of one of the owners, and there's 30 owners, did something like that, said those racial slurs, would they oust the husband? Or would they leave the husband in?\" \n \n Sterling added that the Clippers franchise is her \"passion\" and \"legacy to my family.\" \n \n \"I've been with the team for 33 years, through the good times and the bad times,\" she added. \n \n These comments come nearly two weeks after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver announced a lifetime ban and a $2.5 million fine for Donald Sterling on April 29, following racist comments from the 80-year-old, which were caught on tape and released to the media. \n \n Read: Barbara Walters' Exclusive Interview With V. Stiviano \n \n Being estranged from her husband, Shelly Sterling said she would \"have to accept\" whatever punishment the NBA handed down to him, but that her stake in the team should be separate. \n \n \"I was shocked by what he said. And -- well, I guess whatever their decision is -- we have to live with it,\" she said. \"But I don't know why I should be punished for what his actions were.\" \n \n An NBA spokesman said this evening that league rules would not allow her tol hold on to her share. \n \n \"Under the NBA Constitution, if a controlling owner's interest is terminated by a 3/4 vote, all other team owners' interests are automatically terminated as well,\" NBA spokesman Mike Bass said. \"It doesn't matter whether the owners are related as is the case here. These are the rules to which all NBA owners agreed to as a condition of owning their team.\" \n \n Sherry Sterling's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, disputed the league's reading of its constitution. \n \n \"We do not agree with the league's self-serving interpretation of its constitution, its application to Shelly Sterling or its validity under these unique circumstances,\" O'Donnell said in a statement released this evening in reposnse the NBA. \"We live in a nation of laws. California law and the United States Constitution trump any such interpretation.\" \n \n If the league decides to force Donald Sterling to sell his half of the team, Shelly Sterling doesn't know what he will do, but the possibility of him transferring full ownership to her is something she \"would love him to\" consider. \n \n Related: NBA Bans Clippers Owner Donald Sterling For Life \n \n \"I haven't discussed it with him or talked to him about it,\" she said. \n \n The lack of communication between Rochelle and Donald Sterling led Walters to question whether she plans to file for divorce. \n \n \"For the last 20 years, I've been seeing attorneys for a divorce,\" she said, laughing. \"In fact, I have here-- I just filed-- I was going to file the petition. I signed the petition for a divorce. And it came to almost being filed. And then, my financial advisor and my attorney said to me, 'Not now.'\" \n \n Sterling added that she thinks the stalling of the divorce stems from \"financial arrangements.\" \n \n But she said \"Eventually, I'm going to.\" \n \n She also told Walters she thinks her estranged husband is suffering from \"the onset of dementia.\" \n \n Since Donald Sterling's ban, several celebrities have said they would be willing to buy the team from Sterling, including Oprah Winfrey and Magic Johnson. Sterling remains the owner, though his ban means he can have nothing to do with running the team and can't attend any games. \n \n Silver announced Friday that former Citigroup chairman and former Time Warner chairman Richard Parsons has been named interim CEO of the team, but nothing concrete in terms of ownership or whether Sterling will be forced to sell the team. Parsons will now take over the basic daily operations for the team and oversee the team's president. \n \n Read: What You Need to Know This Week About Donald Sterling \n \n ABC News contacted Donald Sterling for comment on his wife's interview, but he declined.",

(AP) \u2014 A small, private jet has crashed into a house in Maryland's Montgomery County on Monday, killing at least three people on board, authorities said. \n \n Preliminary information indicates at least three people were on board and didn't survive the Monday crash into home in Gaithersburg, a Washington, D.C. suburb, said Pete Piringer, a Montgomery County Fire and Rescue spokesman. \n \n He said a fourth person may have been aboard. \n \n Piringer said the jet crashed into one home around 11 a.m., setting it and two others on fire. Crews had the fire under control within an hour and were searching for anyone who may have been in the homes. \n \n Television news footage of the scene showed one home nearly destroyed, with a car in the driveway. Witnesses told television news crews that they saw the airplane appear to struggle to maintain altitude before going into a nosedive and crashing. \n \n An FAA spokesman said preliminary information shows the Embraer EMB-500/Phenom 100 twin-engine jet was on approach at the nearby Montgomery County Airpark. The National Transportation Safety Board is sending an investigator to the scene. ||||| Gemmell family (Photo: Facebook) \n \n GAITHERSBURG, Md. (WUSA9) -- The investigations into a plane crash that left six people dead in Gaithersburg on Monday evening are just beginning. \n \n A mother and her two young children are three of the six lives lost in the crash. \n \n Marie Gemmell, 36, her three-year-old son Cole and her infant-son Devin were inside their home when a corporate jet crashed into it. Their bodies were found on the second floor hours after the crash. The father and a third child were not home at the time of the crash. \n \n Michael Rosenberg was on the jet that crashed (Photo: Health Decisions) \n \n Three people on the jet were also killed, according to Montgomery County fire officials. One of those victims has been identified as Michael Rosenberg, CEO of Health Decisions. You can read their statement here. \n \n An Embraer EMB-500/Phenom 100 crashed into a house in the 19700 block of Drop Forge Lane off Snouffer School Road in the neighborhood of Hunters Woods around 10:45 a.m., according to the NTSB. The plane was coming from Chapel Hill, NC and approaching the Montgomery County Air Park. \n \n The NTSB has sent a go-team to the site, where three homes were damaged. Firefighters used foam to battle fires all around the scene. The fuselage of the jet is parallel to a second house, and the tail of the airplane is at the front door. One of the wings was catapulted into the Gemmell's house, causing a huge fire and the majority of the damage, according to the NTSB. Senior Investigator Timothy LeBaron is leading the go-team. \n \n Investigators are looking at operations, including crew experience, training and procedures, the functionality of the engines, the weather, air traffic control and more, NTSB spokesperson Robert L. Sumwalt said at a press confrence. \n \n \"Our mission is to find out not only what happened, but why it happened because we want to make sure something like this never happens again,\" Sumwalt said. \n \n MORE: Woman says community feared plane crash \n \n \n \n NTSB investigators are currently collecting perishable evidence, not determining the cause. They'll be conducting interviews and documenting the wreckage. Investigators could be on the scene for three to seven days for what they call the \"fact-finding\" phase. \n \n The black box, which has recordings from the crash, has been recovered. It is in good condition and has been rushed to labs, Sumwalt said. \n \n The first call about the crash came in at 10:44 a.m. from the National Guard Armory for the report of an explosion, and units were on the scene in approximately seven minutes, Montgomery County Fire Chief Steve Lohr said at an initial press conference. Utility crews were also on the scene and Lorh said it is safe for residents in the area. Electricity has been temporarily cut off. \n \n Recordings of the 911-calls from the crash were released on Monday evening. In the recordings neighbors and witnesses describe the scene where the plane crashed in the Gaithersburg neighborhood. \n \n Recordings of the 911 calls from the Gaithersburg plane crash were released on Monday evening. \n \n \"We just heard a giant explosion we looked out the window and there's... it looks like a house is on fire, we've got some people running over there to see if people are okay,\" one caller described. \n \n \n \n RAW: Fire Chief Steve Lohr speaks on plane crash \n \n A woman who was traveling into the area after taking a test at Montgomery College tells WUSA9 that she could see the smoke from the crash from I-370. As she got closer, she saw all the emergency response vehicles and called her husband. He told her that the smoke was coming from the area where her mother and stepfather lived and she says she got worried. She discovered the house that was struck was their neighbors' house. She says there are \"three little ones\" who live in that house. \n \n One person reported seeing the plane \"wobble\" before it crashed into the house. Other neighbors reported hearing repeated booms and feeling their houses shake from the impact of the plane. \n \n Something went wrong with the jet heading to the Montgomery County airport and it went into a house in Gaithersburg \n \n WUSA9 spoke with an eyewitness named Jocelyn Brown who said she first heard the plane sputtering, making a sound that planes that go over the area normally don't make flying over the houses. She says she and her mother became concerned and went to investigate. They then saw the plane hit the side of a house. She reported seeing a \"mushroom effect of smoke\" and also hearing three explosions after the plane hit. \n \n Jocelyn says they also heard screams in the area of the home. She says she does not know whether they were coming from inside the house or behind them. \n \n Jocelyn lives in the area and says she knows the mother that lives there. She described her as a \"sweet woman\" who walks with her kids in the area all the time and speaks to everyone. \n \n He said the plane sounded like it was \"puttering\" and then saw fire \n \n A woman posted video from the ground of the scene of the plane crash on YouTube. \n \n . \n \n The FAA has released the following information: \n \n \"This is preliminary information about an Embraer EMB-500/Phenom 100 twin-engine jet that crashed one mile north of the Montgomery County Airport, Gaithersburg, MD at 11am today. The aircraft was on approach to Runway 14 at the airport when the accident occurred. Please contact local authorities for information on passengers and the situation on the ground. The FAA will investigate.

That information has not been confirmed by the NTSB. \n \n The Montgomery County Air Park is within 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile of the crash. The airport does not have a tower, so communication would have been with Washington Air Traffic Control Section, not the airport. \n \n The FAA registry shows that the plane was a corporate Phenom jet with tail number N100EQ. It's registered to Sage Aviation LLC out of Chapel Hill, NC which makes replacement parts for the aviation industry. \n \n MORE: Gaithersburg plane crash at Drop Forge Lane, 3 houses suffering some sort of damage, this one the worst @WNEWpic.twitter.com/vihz4k5eYE \u2014 JimMacKayWNEW (@JimMacKayWNEW) December 8, 2014 \n \n Snouffer School Road was closed between Centerway Road and Goshen Road following the crash.

        "context": "Tucker Carlson Exposes His Own Sexism on Twitter (Updated) \n \n Tucker Carlson has done some good work in the past\u2026 His site, The Daily Caller, is a frequent stop of mine and many other Conservatives. They were responsible for exposing the Journolist scandal, which highlighted the planning and coordination of many members of the left-wing press. I will always be grateful to Tucker\u2019s team for bringing that story to light. This is also why I am so angered by Tucker\u2019s recent actions. I thought he was better than this. \n \n If you haven\u2019t heard by now, Monday evening, Tucker Carlson posted a disturbing tweet about Governor Palin which said: \n \n Palin\u2019s popularity falling in Iowa, but maintains lead to become supreme commander of Milfistan \n \n Aside from Tucker\u2019s sheep-like response to warped poll numbers, he also failed to take ownership of his sexist comment. He deleted the original (which is why I had to link to a retweet) obviously aware that what he had posted was wrong. Unfortunately for him, many people had already seen it and responded. You can\u2019t put the toothpaste back in the tube, Tucker. \n \n Is this the sort of treatment that Conservative women, who want to get involved in the process, are expected to put up with? Is it okay for male columnists (Conservative or otherwise) to continue objectifying women in the world of politics? No it\u2019s not! \n \n The best thing Tucker Carlson could do, is admit that what he tweeted was wrong, apologize to Governor Palin, and urge his fellow colleagues to be respectful with their language and written word. What he did was demeaning and offensive, and there is no place for it in Conservative circles. \n \n Update: This is a poor attempt at an apology. Tucker Carlson tries to cover his tracks this morning by repeating the same mistakes he made last night. He wrote: \n \n Apparently Charlie Sheen got control of my Twitter account last night while I was at dinner. Apologies for his behavior. \n \n He didn\u2019t take responsibility for his comment and he fails horribly at humor. Try again, and Tucker\u2026 you\u2019re not funny. \n \n Update II: Almost a day later, he finally apologizes: \n \n I\u2019m sorry for last night\u2019s tweet. I meant absolutely no offense. Not the first dumb thing I\u2019ve said. Hopefully the last. \n \n \n \n ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications. You always have the option to delete your Tweet location history. Learn more ||||| I am not down with @karlrove @tuckercarlson misogynist mockery of @sarahpalinusa . Sick of it. ||||| On Monday night, while the rest of the world was watching Charlie Sheen flame out live on CNN, Tucker Carlson took to Twitter to make some impolitic statements of his own. \n \n \"Palin's popularity falling in Iowa, but maintains lead to become supreme commander of Milfistan,\" he wrote. \n \n By the next morning, the tweet was deleted and he had apologized, writing, \u201cApparently Charlie Sheen got control of my Twitter account last night while I was at dinner. Apologies for his behavior.\u201d \n \n But that wasn\u2019t enough to spare him the ire of conservative women on the blogosphere and Twitter. \n \n On Tuesday, before Carlson\u2019s first apology, Stacy Drake, writing on Conservatives4Palin, praised Carlson\u2019s works at The Daily Caller, particularly the leaks of the Journolist emails, saying that\u2019s why his tweet stung so badly. \n \n Aside from Tucker\u2019s sheep-like response to warped poll numbers, he also failed to take ownership of his sexist comment. He deleted the original (which is why I had to link to a retweet) obviously aware that what he had posted was wrong. Unfortunately for him, many people had already seen it and responded. You can\u2019t put the toothpaste back in the tube, Tucker. \n \n \n \n Is this the sort of treatment that Conservative women, who want to get involved in the process, are expected to put up with? Is it okay for male columnists (Conservative or otherwise) to continue objectifying women in the world of politics? No it\u2019s not! \n \n \n \n She was unimpressed with his first apology, and called for him to apologize to Palin while continuing to denounce him for sexism on her Twitter account. \n \n Michelle Malkin joined the calls Tuesday, tweeting: \u201cI am not down with @karlrove @tuckercarlson misogynist mockery of @sarahpalinusa. Sick of it.\u201d \n \n Later Tuesday, Carlson obliged: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for last night\u2019s tweet. I meant absolutely no offense. Not the first dumb thing I\u2019ve said. Hopefully the last.\u201d \n \n Some bros have come to Carlson's aid. Tuesday, Erick Erickson tweeted, \"Maybe my sense of humor needs to be recalibrated, but when I heard @TuckerCarlson's MILFistan comment, I laughed then got out my passport.\" \n \n (Needless to say, Drake was not amused.) \n \n But by Wednesday, the thing had escalated into a full-blown war of the sexes within the conservative blogosphere, with Whitney Pitcher taking Carlson's tweet as inspiration for her post on Conservatives4Palin: \"MILF\u2013Misogynists (and Elites) I\u2019d Like to Fulminate.\" \n \n Perhaps an additional reason that Governor Palin does not win the respect of the Elite and Establishment is that you cannot be praised for your \u201cperfectly creased pants\u201d if you often wear a skirt, right David Brooks? The continued line of attack from the Establishment and Elite men in the GOP have come as a result of Governor Palin\u2019s genetic makeup. \n \n This post has been updated to correct the spelling of Stacy Drake's first name.",

        "summary_from_lingua": "### Summary of Recent News\n\nThe recent news cycle has centered around political controversies, particularly involving public figures and their interactions with the media and the broader public. One notable figure in this context is Governor Sarah Palin, whose actions and comments have drawn significant criticism from members of the Republican Party establishment.\n\nGovernor Palin has faced ongoing scrutiny and attacks from prominent figures within the Republican Party, including David Brooks, a well-known commentator. These attacks are rooted in what some perceive as a double standard regarding gender and attire. Specifically, there is a suggestion that it is easier to praise someone for maintaining \"perfectly creased pants\" if they adhere to traditional gender norms, such as wearing trousers, rather than skirts. This critique highlights a perceived inconsistency in how male and female public figures are judged based on their appearance and behavior.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Governor Palin has escalated, with some commentators arguing that her genetic makeup is being used as a basis for criticism. This suggests a deeper issue within the Republican Party establishment, where there",
        "summary_from_longlingua": "### Summary of Recent News\n\nThe recent news highlights ongoing discussions and controversies surrounding sexism and gender dynamics, particularly within political circles and social media platforms like Twitter. One of the key issues revolves around the treatment of women in conservative circles, where they are often dismissed or \"written off\" as \"sheep-like\" and \"sweet,\" according to some commentators. This sentiment reflects a broader critique of how women in politics, especially those with non-traditional appearances, are frequently marginalized or undermined by male-dominated establishments.\n\nA notable example is the case of Governor Sarah Palin, whose genetic makeup has been cited as part of an ongoing attack from conservative men in the Republican Party (GOP). This criticism extends beyond her political views to include personal aspects of her identity, suggesting that her authenticity or qualifications are being questioned due to her gender and appearance. The implication here is that women in leadership roles must adhere to certain standards, such as wearing \"perfectly creased pants,\" which is seen as a form of sexism.\n\n",
        "summary_from_lingua2": "### Summary of Recent News Developments\n\nIn recent weeks, the media landscape has been marked by controversies surrounding gender dynamics and political correctness, particularly within conservative circles. These events have highlighted ongoing debates about sexism, accountability, and the role of social media in shaping public discourse.\n\nOne of the most notable incidents involved Tucker Carlson, a prominent conservative commentator on Fox News. Carlson faced criticism for making impolitic statements that were perceived as sexist. In response, he deleted his original tweet, which had sparked controversy. This incident underscored the challenges faced by media figures in navigating sensitive topics while maintaining their public image.\n\nAnother significant development was the fallout from the Journolist scandal, which exposed internal tensions within the left-leaning media establishment. The scandal revealed a series of actions and tweets that were seen as undermining the credibility of certain journalists and outlets. This event highlighted the broader issue of accountability within the media industry, particularly among those who are vocal critics of conservative viewpoints.\n\nStacy Drake, another conservative commentator, also",
