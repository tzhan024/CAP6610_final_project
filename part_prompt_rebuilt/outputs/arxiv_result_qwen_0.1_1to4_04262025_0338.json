If left unattended, performance degradation can cause robots to fail or perform sub-optimally <cit.>. Timely operator intervention or triggering of recovery behaviours can mitigate this. Using Levels of Autonomy (LoA) <cit.>, the extent of control that a human operator has over the robot's actions can be varied. For example during high performance degradation, an autonomous robot can be switched to manual control by an experienced human operator. The LoA can be switched back once the robot is capable of functioning autonomously again.\n\nIn Human Initiative (HI) LoA switching systems, the robot operator is in charge of LoA regulation during the task. Compared to fully autonomous robots, manually controlled robots, and other implementations of variable autonomy systems, HI-LoA shows better task performance during remote navigation tasks in unknown environments <cit.>. However, the additional perceptual and mental effort required to monitor robot operation data and determine if LoA switching is needed, imposes comparatively higher levels of cognitive workload on the operator. While overloading an operator's cognitive abilities for prolonged periods can reduce task performance <cit.> due to stress, fatigue and varying levels of trust in the system <cit.>, low workload can cause out-of-loop performance problems like complacency and over-trusting the system <cit.>.\n\nEffective HI-LoA system design remains an open problem in existing literature <cit.>. A well-designed system should keep operator cognitive workload within a sweet spot  <cit.> (i.e., acceptable levels). LoA switches by operators should be due to a clear understanding of the robot's capabilities and limitations, not due to trust issues. Transparent design, i.e., where the operator can accurately interpret the robot's capabilities, goals, and its progress, have reported effective calibration of trust <cit.>, even with increasing levels of automation <cit.>. Systems where information about the robot is presented over the graphic/visual modalities are trusted more than the audio and textual modalities <cit.>. Independent of systems design considerations, significant differences still exist in people's perceived reliability of variable autonomy systems. However, they can be minimised through standardised training <cit.>. \n\n\u00a7 SYSTEM DESIGN\n\n\nThe experiment consisted of two tasks, similar to the experiments setup by Chiou et al. <cit.>. The primary task was a mobile robot navigation task using the Clearpath Husky Robot, simulated on Gazebo. As shown in Figure <ref>, these arenas were designed to mimic urban search and rescue scenarios, and were populated with performance degrading factors commonly found in them like - obstacles, uneven terrain and laser noise. A 2D laser scan of an empty map (Figure <ref> - Right) was generated before the performance degrading factors were added. The difference between the map used for robot navigation and the actual arena affects robot navigation planning, thereby adding another performance degrading factor. Two different arenas were created to compare operator performance with (condition A) and without the Health Bar (condition B). \n\n\n\n\nRViz was used to visualise the robot map, sensor data, and give commands to the robot. The standard RViz interface in Figure <ref> was used for Condition B, and the interface with a Robot Health Bar  shown in Figure <ref> was used for Condition A. The Husky robot used two LoAs - 1) Waypoint-based navigation and 2) Manual Control by an operator using a Joystick. The Robot Health at each instant was calculated using the Robot Vitals and Robot Health framework <cit.>, and the Health Bar was created and displayed using the JSK Visualisations[http://wiki.ros.org/jsk_visualization/] ROS Package. Here, Robot Health is defined as an overall scalar estimate of a robot\u2019s ability to carry out its tasks without its capabilities being impaired by any performance degrading factors . Therefore, an operator can monitor the health to detect situations where a robot is likely to fail, and trigger LoA switches to assist the robot. To improve readability, the Robot Health was standardised to the range [0,1]. The Red-Amber-Green colour coding convention was used for the Health Bar as shown in Figure <ref>. Based on preliminary experiments, health above 0.7 was decided as Healthy , and the colour of the Health Bar was green. Values between 0.5-0.7 were coloured in amber, and values below 0.5 were coloured red. Instead of sharp colour changes, the Health Bar gradually went from green to amber to red. This was done to minimise rapid colour changes due to small fluctuations in health near the threshold values.\n\n\u00a7 EXPERIMENT METHODOLOGY\n\nEight test subjects participated in the experiment and performed both conditions (i.e. within subjects design). The order of the conditions was counterbalanced to minimise learning and fatigue effects. First, participants had to fill out background information (see appendix <ref>). Then they were introduced to basic robot navigation in a training arena similar to the one used in Chiou et al.<cit.>. All participants trained on this arena till they were able to demonstrate a minimum proficiency in robot navigation. This ensured that confounding factors due to a variation in skill levels were minimised. Next, they were shown the 2 different LoA, how to switch between them and were given some time to practice LoA switching on the training arena. \n\nParticipants were then introduced to the interface with the Health Bar and asked open-ended questions without prior explanation (see appendix <ref>). After answering the questions, they were given the following instructions regarding the Health Bar: \u201cThe Robot Health Bar indicates how much a robot\u2019s performance is degraded by environmental factors. These environmental factors can be anything ranging from bad terrain to laser noise. During low health, the Health Bar will become redder. During high health, the Health Bar will become greener. The lower the robot's health, the more likely it will fail. You may use the Health Bar to help you determine when the robot requires a LoA switching\u201d. The effect of performance degrading factors on the Health Bar was demonstrated by introducing obstacles and laser noise in the training arena. Participants were also given time to familiarise themselves with the interface before starting the navigation task. Next participants were familiarised only with the secondary task, and allowed multiple practice runs till they felt comfortable with it. Their baseline on the secondary task alone was measured before the experiment.\n\n\n\nBefore each condition, participants were shown the start and finish points in the navigation task and told that the next waypoint would be assigned automatically on reaching the current one. Then the participants carried out each experimental condition followed by a NASA-TLX form to evaluate the perceived cognitive workload during the task. Lastly, participants completed open-ended questions and a transparency/trust questionnaire after the experimental trials and the NASA-TLX forms (see <ref> and <ref>).\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 RESULTS\n\n\nRobot health values under 0.7 were classified as unhealthy . This criterion was heuristically determined based on previous studies on the robot vitals and robot health framework <cit.>. Results from the experiments conducted on 8 participants were computed and tested for statistical differences using two-tailed pairwise T-Tests. These results are summarised in table <ref>.\n\nThe total percentage of runtime that the robot was autonomous, manually controlled and unhealthy  was calculated for each experimental condition. The percentage of run time that the robot health was unhealthy  showed no statistical differences between the two conditions. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in the percentage of run time the robot was manually controlled. However, the percentage of run time that the robot was manually controlled when it was unhealthy, showed a significant (p <0.05, t = -2.36) difference between both conditions. That is, operators manually controlled unhealthy robots for longer when the health of the robot was displayed (i.e., Condition A). As a result, the robot was unhealthy  for an average of 61.91% of the runtime in condition A, but 78.03% of the runtime in condition B.\n\nThe change in perceptual effort required to carry out LoA switching tasks was measured using the operator's accuracy on the secondary task. When the health bar was not displayed (Condition B), operators showed significantly higher levels of accuracy (p <0.05, t = 2.36) on the secondary task. This indicates the perceptual effort required to use the interface with the robot health bar, is higher. However, the NASA-TLX scores showed no significant differences in the overall cognitive workload imposed by both conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen-ended questions asked before the experiment showed that some participants were slightly confused about what the Robot Health Bar was. One participant said - \"The health bar looks like a timer, because it has a number. I thought it meant seconds\". Others successfully grasped the idea behind the UI element. Another participant thought \"When the number goes down the robot dies\", indicating a game-like perception of the Health Bar's function. However, all participants understood it was there to assist or alert an operator performance degradation.\n\n\n",

The goal is to reduce cognitive demand and perceptual effort required for LoA regulation, while promoting trust and transparency between the human operator and the robot.\n\n#### Background and Motivation\nMobile robots operating in uncertain environments can experience performance degradation due to factors such as uneven terrain, obstacles, and sensor noise. In such cases, timely intervention by a human operator can mitigate potential failures. HI-LoA systems allow operators to adjust the level of control they exert over the robot, but this requires significant perceptual and mental effort. Overloading the operator can lead to reduced task performance due to stress and fatigue, while low workload can result in complacency and over-trust in the system.

rapidly growing. \nThe market size was valued at USD 14.7 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 4.8% from 2022 to 2029 <cit.>.\nA driving force underlying the rapid expansion of the market is the widespread availability of e-books, which enables us to easily access comics around the world.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also helped the growth of the comic market because the lockdown in many countries increased the demand for comics. \nManga, Japanese comics, has been especially popular on a global scale.\nMany manga have been translated into different languages.\nFor example, over 510 million copies of One Piece have circulated worldwide; One Piece is recorded in the Guinness Book of Records as the best-selling comic in the history <cit.>.\nThe history of the development of manga culture in Japan, its social background, and its global prevalence have been studied <cit.>.\n\n\nOur social networks are complex but characterized by common properties such as heterogeneity and community structure <cit.>. \nBecause literally all storylines of manga rely on interactions among characters,  social networks among characters, which are often called character networks, may provide a backbone of the story of manga and influence its popularity. \nMore generally, character networks have been analyzed for quantitatively characterizing fiction works <cit.>.\nA number of problems can be addressed through analyses of character networks, such as summarization <cit.>, classification <cit.>, and role detection <cit.>.\nCharacter networks have been studied for a variety of fiction such as novels <cit.>, plays <cit.>,  movies <cit.>, and TV series <cit.>.\nHowever, character networks for comics have been rarely explored except for Marvel comics <cit.>\nand a few manga titles <cit.>. \nOne possible reason for this is the difficulty of automating data collection for comics <cit.>.\n\n\n\n\nIn the present study, we analyze character networks of 162 popular Japanese manga that span decades and test the following two hypotheses. \nFirst, we expect that popular manga tend to produce realistic social networks.\nTherefore, we hypothesize that structural and temporal properties of the character networks of manga are similar to those of human social networks. \nSecond, our data enables us to investigate how trends of manga have changed over approximately 70 years. \nTherefore, we hypothesize that character networks of modern manga and old ones are systematically different. \nWe also examine differences in the network structure between manga mainly targeting boys versus girls. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a7 RESULTS\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Similarities to Empirical Social Networks\n\nOur original data are equivalent to a temporal bipartite graph in which the two types of nodes are characters and pages, and the edges connect characters to the pages in which they appear. \nThe pages are ordered in time.\nWe show the degree distribution for the character nodes for One Piece and the Poisson distribution with the same mean in Fig.\u00a0<ref>A. \nThe coefficient of variation (CV), which is defined as the standard deviation divided by the average, of the original degree distribution is 1.66. \nThis value is approximately 11.1 times larger than that of the Poisson distribution. \nTherefore, similar to human social networks <cit.>, the characters in manga have heterogeneous numbers of connections, and there are a small number of characters that appear disproportionately frequently on various pages. \nWe obtained similar results for the other manga (see https://github.com/KS-92/MangaSI file).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, the CV of the degree distribution for the page nodes is 0.462 for One Piece. \nThe CV for the Poisson distribution with the same mean is 0.580.\nTherefore, we argue that the characters do not appear uniformly randomly over the pages. \nAs we show in Fig.\u00a0<ref>B, there are typically two or three characters on a page in One Piece, and pages containing none or just one character are relatively rare.\nWe obtained similar results for the other manga (see https://github.com/KS-92/MangaSI file).\nThese results suggest that the high heterogeneity of the characters in terms of the frequency of appearance on pages and the tendency of a page typically containing two or three characters are two common properties of manga. \nTherefore, in the following analyses, we consider the bipartite configuration model, in which the degrees of all character and page nodes are preserved and the edges are otherwise randomly placed, as a null model. \nThen, we examine properties of character networks that we can explain by the null model versus those we cannot.\n\n\nWe show the weighted character network, which is the projection of the bipartite graph onto the space of character nodes, for One Piece in Fig.\u00a0<ref> (see https://github.com/KS-92/MangaSI Fig.\u00a0S1 for the networks for all 162 manga). \nBy definition, the edge weight is equal to the number of pages in which the two characters simultaneously appear.\nThe character networks vary widely in size from manga to manga.\nSpecifically, the number of nodes, N, ranges from 8 to 124, with mean\u00b1 standard   deviation=32.6 \u00b1 16.6. \nThe number of edges, M, ranges from 19 to 950, with mean\u00b1 standard   deviation=156.1 \u00b1 128.9. \nWe define the protagonist as the node with the largest node strength (i.e., weighted degree) in the character network.\nThe protagonist is the character that appears in the largest number of pages for most manga (97.5%).\n\u00a7 DISCUSSION\n\nWe found that the empirical character networks have various features consistent with empirical social networks.\nThe bipartite configuration model, which is a standard random bipartite graph, has been shown to be reasonably accurate at explaining some features of the empirical character networks including statistics of the node's strength, \u03b1 values, disassortativity, and the high clustering coefficients.\nIn contrast, there are other features of the empirical character networks that deviate from the expectation from the bipartite configuration graph.\nSuch features include statistics of the degree, the IET distributions, and speeds of epidemic spreading.\nWe suggested that part of these differences originates from the protagonist-centered nature of the character networks. \nIn other words, the protagonist interacts with most characters, while non-protagonist characters tend to interact only with the protagonist and a smaller number of other characters than expected by the configuration model.    \nThere are positive support of protagonist-centered social networks in the real world when the network is egocentric\n <cit.>.\n\nSimilarities between character networks and human social networks have been investigated for some fictions such as Marvel comics <cit.>, Shakespeare's plays <cit.>, and myths <cit.>.\nOur results of the high clustering coefficient and the heavy-tailed distribution of the strength in the character networks are consistent with these previous studies.\nHowever, we ascribe the high clustering coefficient to the effect of one-mode projection rather than to similarity to empirical social networks because the randomized character networks also have high clustering.\nOur results of the disassortativity is also consistent with the results for Marvel comics <cit.> and myths <cit.>.\nTherefore, we infer that the heavy-tailed distribution of the strength and disassortativity in the character networks are common properties for various types of fictions.\nAlthough the aforementioned previous studies investigated only the static properties of the character networks, we further revealed temporal properties of the character networks, such as the long-tailed IET distributions, which are in fact consistent with empirical social networks <cit.>. \n\n\nWe also found that the trend of the manga character networks has shifted over decades. \nSpecifically, more modern manga tend to have fewer characters, denser and be less protagonist-centered for the boys\u2019 manga, which may reflect a modern change in the society that places more emphasis on diversity and teamwork <cit.>.\nIn contrast, the character networks in the girls' manga have shifted toward more protagonist-centered, although the downward trend in the number of characters is common.\nIn general, girls' manga in Japan tend to revolve around issues of love and friendship with a focus on inner feelings of the protagonist <cit.>.\n\u00a7 MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Data Collection\n\nWe focus on manga of which more than 10 million copies have been published in Japan as of January 2021 <cit.>.\nSince the physical size of the manga may affect the number of panels per page and we adopted the page as the unit of analysis, we excluded the manga that had not been published in the paperback pocket edition (112   mm\u00d7 174   mm).\nNote that the paperback pocket edition is the most common for the boys' and girls' manga in Japan.\nAs a result, we included 162 manga (see https://github.com/KS-92/MangaSI file for the list of the 162 manga).\n\nWe prepared a data table of time-stamped copresence of characters for each manga as follows. \nFor each manga, we manually examined volumes one through three.\nAll the selected 162 manga had at least three volumes.\nThen, we first extracted all the characters whose name, blood relation to a named character, or job title that uniquely identifies the character, is known. \nTo ensure the reproducibility of this work, we avoided to use any other information sources  (e.g., other volumes of the same manga, the Internet, or anime) to attempt to identify more characters. \nIn practice, such additional information sources would not contribute to identifying many more characters. \nSecond, we recorded the copresence of characters on each page as interaction between the characters.\nNote that the copresence is the most common definition of interaction in constructing character networks in fictional works <cit.>.\nWe used copresence on a page rather than in a single panel within a page because it is common that characters appearing in different panels on the same page have some interactions (e.g., two characters talk to each other by using alternately occupying successive panels).\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 Bipartite Configuration Model\n\nThe original data from which we construct the temporal and static character networks are equivalent to a temporal bipartite graph in which the two types of nodes are characters and pages, and an edge connects a character and a page in which the character appears.\nTo generate a randomized bipartite network, we choose a pair of edges in this bipartite graph uniformly at random, denoted by (c, p) and (c', p'), where c and c' are characters and p and p' are pages.\nIf c and c' are the same or p and p' are the same, we discard the pairs and redraw them. \nThen, we rewire the two original edges to (c, p') and (c', p). \nWe repeat this procedure 1,000 times excluding the discarded edge pairs to generate a randomized temporal bipartite network. \nWe construct a static randomized character network from the generated randomized bipartite graph by one-mode projection. \nIn other words, we connect two characters by an edge whose weight is the number of pages on which the two characters are copresent.\n\n\n\n\n \u00a7.\u00a7 SI Model\n\n\nWe use the SI model <cit.> to numerically investigate contagion.",

They manually extracted characters based on their names, blood relations, and job titles. To ensure the integrity of the data, they avoided using external information sources that could introduce bias. The interactions between characters were defined as instances where characters appeared together on the same page, engaging in dialogue or other forms of communication.

They generate a randomized temporal bipartite network by randomly rewiring the edges of the original network while ensuring that no character or page is duplicated in the process. This method helps in understanding the underlying structure of the network without bias introduced by specific interactions. From this randomized bipartite network, they construct a static randomized character network using a one-mode projection technique, where characters are connected based on their co-occurrence in the same pages.\n\nTo further investigate the spread of influence or information within these networks, the researchers apply the Susceptible-Infected (",

The set of all n-by-1 column vectors is identified with the set of all ordered n-tuples with entries in \u2102 and thus denoted by \u2102^n. If x \u2208\u2102^n, then x_i denotes the ith entry of x. The n-by-n identity matrix is denoted by I = I_n and e_k denotes the kth column of I.\n\nGiven A \u2208\ud835\uddac_n, we let \n\n    \n  * \u03c3(A) denote the spectrum (i.e., multiset of eigenvalues) of A;\n    \n  * A_(k) denote the (n-1)-by-(n-1) principal submatrix obtained by deleting the kth row and kth column of A); and\n    \n  * A^\u2217 denotes the conjugate transpose of A.\n\n\nIf A \u2208\ud835\uddac_n and B \u2208\ud835\uddac_m, then the direct sum of A and B, denoted by A \u2295 B, is defined by \n\n    A \u2295 B =[ A 0; 0 B ].\n\n\nIf U \u2208\ud835\uddac_n, then U is called unitary if U^* U = I. If A \u2208\ud835\uddac_n, then A is called normal if A^* A = A A^*. A matrix A is normal if and only if there is a unitary matrix U and a diagonal matrix D such that A = U D U^* <cit.>.\n\nThe field (of values) or numerical range of A \u2208\ud835\uddac_n), denoted by F(A), is defined by F(A) = { x^*A x | x^*x = 1 }\u2286\u2102. A general reference for the field is <cit.>.\n\nIf S = {\u03bb_1,\u2026,\u03bb_n }\u2282\u2102 (repetitions allowed), then the convex hull of S is denoted by S = (S).\n\nThe following well-known properties will be useful in the sequel: \n\n\n \n    fvprops\n        If A = [a_ij] \u2208\ud835\uddac_n and B \u2208\ud835\uddac_m, then:\n     \n            \n            \n  *  \u03c3(A) \u2286 F(A) <cit.>; \n            \n  *  F(A) = (\u03c3(A)), whenever A is normal <cit.>; \n            \n  * ds F ( A\u2295 B ) = (F(A) \u222a F(B)) <cit.>;  \n            \n  *  F(A_(k)) \u2286 F(A), \u2200  k \u2208{1,\u2026, n } <cit.>; and\n            \n  * F(A) is convex <cit.>.\n    \n\n\n\nFor completeness, we give a proof of Property 1.2.11 <cit.>, which generalizes part <ref>, given that it is ubiquitous in the literature; the proof-strategy suggested by Horn and Johnson is tedious; and ideas presented in the demonstration will be used in the sequel. \n\nTo this end, let \u03b1 = {\u03b1_1, \u2026, \u03b1_m } be a nonempty subset of {1, \u2026, n} (if \u03b1 = \u2205, then F(A[\u03b1]) = \u2205\u2286 F(A)) and denote by A[\u03b1] the m-by-m matrix whose (i,j) entry is a_\u03b1_i, \u03b1_j, 1 \u2264 i,j \u2264 m.

If y:=Px, then y^*y=x^*P^\u22a4 Px = x^*I_m x= x^*x=1. Furthermore,\n\n    z = x^* A[\u03b1] x = x^* P^\u22a4 A P x=(Px)^*APx = y^*Ay \u2208 F(A),\n \ni.e, F(A[\u03b1]) \u2286 F(A).\n\n\nIf A \u2208\ud835\uddac_n(\u2102), then A is called convexoid if F(A) = (\u03c3(A)). Johnson <cit.> gave the following characterization of convexoid matrices.\n\n\n\n    convexoid\n        If A \u2208\ud835\uddac_n(\u2102), then A is convexoid if and only if A is normal or there is a unitary matrix U such that \n        \n    U^\u2217 A U = [ A_1   0;   0 A_2 ],\n\n        where A_1 is normal and F(A_2) \u2286 F(A_1).\n\n\n\u00a7 MAIN RESULT\n\n\n\n\n    rotevec\n        Let Av= \u03bb v,  where v \u2260 0 and v_k \u2260 0. If v_k = rexp(i \u03b8), where \u03b8\u2208 (-\u03c0,\u03c0], then w:= exp(-i\u03b8)v is an eigenvector such that v _2 =  w _2 and w_k > 0.\n\n\n\n    The conclusion that w is an eigenvector with the same length as v follows from the fact that |exp(-i\u03b8)| = 1. Lastly, notice that w_k = exp(-i\u03b8) (rexp(i \u03b8)) = r > 0.\n\n\n\n\n    projection\n        Let \u03b1 = {\u03b1_1, \u2026, \u03b1_m } be a nonempty subset of {1, \u2026, n}, let P:= [ e_\u03b1_1     \u22ef e_\u03b1_m ], and let y \u2208\u2102^n be any vector such that y_k  = 0 whenever k \u2209\u03b1. If x:= P^\u22a4 y \u2208\u2102^m, then y = Px and y^\u2217 y = x^\u2217 x.\n\n\n\n    Since PP^\u22a4 = \u2211_k=1^m e_\u03b1_ke_\u03b1_k^\u22a4, it follows that \n    \n    Px = P(P^\u22a4 y) = (P P^\u22a4) y = ( \u2211_k=1^m e_\u03b1_ke_\u03b1_k^\u22a4) y = \u2211_k=1^m e_\u03b1_k y_\u03b1_k.\n\n    If z := \u2211_k=1^m e_\u03b1_k, then z_k = 0 whenever k \u2209\u03b1. Thus, y = Px and \n    \n    y^\u2217 y = (Px)^\u2217 (Px) = x^\u2217 P^\u22a4 P x = x^\u2217 I_m x = x^\u2217 x,\n\n    as desired.\n\n\n\n\n    main\n        If A is convexoid, then F(A_(k)) is inscribed in the polygon \u2202 F(A), \u2200 k \u2208{1,\u2026,n}.\n\n\n\nIn view of fvprops<ref> and convexoid, it suffices to consider the case when A is normal.\n\nTo this end, if A is normal, then there is a diagonal matrix D = (\u03bb_1,\u2026,\u03bb_n) and a unitary matrix U such that A = UDU^*. \n\nLet \u03bb_i and \u03bb_j be adjacent vertices of the polygon \u2202(\u03bb_1,\u2026,\u03bb_n), let v := U e_i, and let w := Ue_j. Note that v^\u2217 v = w^\u2217 w = 1 and v^\u2217 w = w^\u2217 v = 0. We distinguish the following cases:\n\n\n  * v_k = 0 or w_k =0. If \n\n    \u03b3 := {1,\u2026,n }\\{k} = {\u03b3_1,\u2026, \u03b3_n-1},\n\n\n    P := [   e_\u03b3_1       \u22ef e_\u03b3_n-1 ],\n \nand x := P^\u22a4 v, then v = Px and x^\u2217 x = 1 by projection. Thus, \n\n    \u03bb_i = v^\u2217 Av = (Px)^\u2217 A (Px) = x^\u2217 P^\u22a4 A P x = x^\u2217 A_(k) x \u2208 F(A_(k)),\n\ni.e., F(A_(k)) \u2229(\u03bb_i-1,\u03bb_i)\u2205 and F(A_(k)) \u2229(\u03bb_i,\u03bb_i+1)\u2205 (if i=1, then i-1 := d). \n\nSimilarly, if w_k = 0, then \u03bb_j \u2208 F(A_(k)). If v_k = w_k = 0, then the line-segment (\u03bb_i,\u03bb_j)\u2286 F(A_(k)) by fvprops<ref>. \n    \n\n  * v_k  0 and w_k  0. By rotevec, it may be assumed, without loss of generality, that v_k > 0 and w_k > 0. If \n\n    \u03b1 := \u2213 w_k/\u221a(v_k^2 + w_k^2) and \u03b2 := \u00b1 v_k/\u221a(v_k^2 + w_k^2),\n\nthen \u03b1 and \u03b2 are nonzero reals such that \u03b1^2 + \u03b2^2 = 1. If u := \u03b1 v + \u03b2 w, then \n\n    u_k = \u03b1 v_k + \u03b2 w_k = \u2213 v_k w_k/\u221a(v_k^2 + w_k^2) + \u00b1 v_k w_k/\u221a(v_k^2 + w_k^2) = 0\n\nand, since v^\u2217 v = w^\u2217 w = 1 and v^\u2217 w = w^\u2217 v = 0, it follows that\n\n    u^\u2217 u = (\u03b1 v^\u2217 + \u03b2 w^\u2217)(\u03b1 v + \u03b2 w) = \u03b1^2v^\u2217 v + \u03b1\u03b2 v^\u2217 w + \u03b2\u03b1 w^\u2217 v + \u03b2^2 w^\u2217 w = \u03b1^2 + \u03b2^2 = 1\n\nand \n\n    u^\u2217 A u \n           = (\u03b1 v^\u2217 + \u03b2 w^\u2217) (\u03b1 A v + \u03b2 Aw)                                                   \n       = (\u03b1 v^* + \u03b2 w^*)(\u03b1\u03bb_i v + \u03b2\u03bb_j w)                                         \n       = \u03b1^2 \u03bb_i v^\u2217 v + \u03b1\u03b2 v^\u2217 w + \u03b2\u03b1 w^\u2217 v + \u03b2^2 \u03bb_jw^\u2217 w  \n       = \u03b1^2 \u03bb_i + \u03b2^2 \u03bb_j.\n\nBecause \u03b1^2 + \u03b2^2 = 1, \u03b1^2 > 0, and \u03b2^2 > 0, it follows that u^\u2217 A u lies in the interior of the line-segment (\u03bb_i,\u03bb_j). Finally, if x := P^\u22a4 u \u2208\u2102^n-1, where \u03b3 and P are defined as in (<ref>) and (<ref>), respectively, then u = Px and x^\u2217 x = 1 (by projection) and \n\n\u00a7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n\nThe authors thank the National Science Foundation for funding and the University of Washington Bothell for hosting REU Site: Tiling Theory, Knot Theory, Optimization, Matrix Analysis, and Image Reconstruction.
