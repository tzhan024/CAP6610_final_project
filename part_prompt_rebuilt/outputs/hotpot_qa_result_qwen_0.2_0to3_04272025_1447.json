Walter Gillings was editor for the first two issues, and was then replaced by John Carnell, the editor of \"New Worlds\", as a cost-saving measure.  Carnell edited both magazines until Nova went out of business in early 1964.  The titles were acquired by Roberts & Vinter, who hired Kyril Bonfiglioli to edit \"Science Fantasy\"; Bonfiglioli changed the title to \"Impulse\" in early 1966, but the new title led to confusion with the distributors and sales fell, though the magazine remained profitable.  The title was changed again to \"SF Impulse\" for the last few issues.  \"Science Fantasy\" ceased publication the following year, when Roberts & Vinter came under financial pressure after their printer went bankrupt. \n\nThe Divide trilogy is a fantasy young adult novel trilogy by Elizabeth Kay, which takes place in an alternate universe.

A patriarchal society, the Kazon have a low opinion of women, and place pride in men becoming warriors and proving themselves in battle.  The Kazon storylines frequently revolve around the attempts of Jal Culluh and his Kazon sect to steal technology from the USS \"Voyager\", with the assistance of former \"Voyager\" ensign Seska.  During the second season, the \"Voyager\" crew uncover more about the alien species' history and culture through a temporary truce.  In their final appearance, the Kazon successfully commandeer \"Voyager\", but are eventually forced to surrender and retreat.  The alien species have minor cameo appearances and references in the show's subsequent seasons, and have also been included in \"Star Trek Online\" and novels set in the \"Star Trek\" universe. \n\nVictoria Hanley is an American young adult fantasy novelist.

Like the adult series, the books were published by Tyndale House Publishing, and released over the 7 year period of 1997-2004.  The series has sold over 11 million copies worldwide. \n\n",
