Walter Gillings was editor for the first two issues, and was then replaced by John Carnell, the editor of \"New Worlds\", as a cost-saving measure.  Carnell edited both magazines until Nova went out of business in early 1964.  The titles were acquired by Roberts & Vinter, who hired Kyril Bonfiglioli to edit \"Science Fantasy\"; Bonfiglioli changed the title to \"Impulse\" in early 1966, but the new title led to confusion with the distributors and sales fell, though the magazine remained profitable.  The title was changed again to \"SF Impulse\" for the last few issues.  \"Science Fantasy\" ceased publication the following year, when Roberts & Vinter came under financial pressure after their printer went bankrupt. \n\nThe Divide trilogy is a fantasy young adult novel trilogy by Elizabeth Kay, which takes place in an alternate universe.

A patriarchal society, the Kazon have a low opinion of women, and place pride in men becoming warriors and proving themselves in battle.  The Kazon storylines frequently revolve around the attempts of Jal Culluh and his Kazon sect to steal technology from the USS \"Voyager\", with the assistance of former \"Voyager\" ensign Seska.  During the second season, the \"Voyager\" crew uncover more about the alien species' history and culture through a temporary truce.

Like the adult series, the books were published by Tyndale House Publishing, and released over the 7 year period of 1997-2004.  The series has sold over 11 million copies worldwide. \n\n",

        "context": "Esma Sultan is the name of three daughters of three Ottoman Sultans: \n\nEsma Sultan (17 July 1778 \u2013 4 June 1848) was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Abdul Hamid I, sister of Sultan Mustafa IV and Sultan Mahmud II.  She was the adoptive mother of Bezmi\u00e2lem Sultan and Rahime Perestu Sultan. \n\nThe Laleli Mosque (Turkish: \"Laleli Camii, or Tulip Mosque\" ) is an 18th-century Ottoman imperial mosque located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey. \n\nGevheri Kad\u0131n (8 July 1856\u00a0\u2013 6 September 1884) was the fifth wife of 32nd Ottoman Sultan Abd\u00fclaziz.  She was the mother of \u015eehzade Mehmed Seyfeddin and Esma Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. \n\nEsma Sultan (14 March 1726 \u2013 13 August 1788) was an Ottoman princess, daughter of Sultan Ahmed III and his consort Zeynep Kad\u0131n.  She was the half-sister of Sultan Mustafa III and Abdul Hamid I. \n\nThe Great Mosque of Algiers (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631\u200e \u200e , \"Jemaa Kebir\") or \u201cDjama\u2019a al-Kebir\u201d (meaning Great Mosque) is a mosque in Algiers, Algeria, located very close to Algiers Harbor.  An inscription on the minbar (\u0645\u0646\u0628\u0631) or the pulpit testifies to fact that the mosque was built in 1097.  It is also known by several other names such as Grand Mosque d'Alger, Djamaa al-Kebir, El Kebir Mosque and Jami Masjid.  It is one of the few remaining examples of Almoravid architecture.  It is the oldest mosque in Algiers and is said to be the oldest mosque in Algeria after Sidi Okba Mosque.  It was built under sultan Ali ibn Yusuf.  Its minaret dates from 1332 (1324 in some sources) and was built by the Ziyyanid Sultan of Tlemcen.  The gallery at the outside of the mosque was built in 1840.  Its construction was a consequence of a complete reconstruction of the street by the French. \n\nThe Sultan Ahmed Mosque or Sultan Ahmet Mosque (Turkish: \"Sultan Ahmet Camii\" ) is a historic mosque located in Istanbul, Turkey.  A popular tourist site, the Sultan Ahmed Mosque continues to function as a mosque today; men still kneel in prayer on the mosque's lush red carpet after the call to prayer.  The Blue Mosque, as it is popularly known, was constructed between 1609 and 1616 during the rule of Ahmed I.  Its K\u00fclliye contains Ahmed's tomb, a madrasah and a hospice.  Hand-painted blue tiles adorn the mosque\u2019s interior walls, and at night the mosque is bathed in blue as lights frame the mosque\u2019s five main domes, six minarets and eight secondary domes.  It sits next to the Hagia Sophia, another popular tourist site. \n\nEsma Sultan (21 March 1873 \u2013 7 May 1899) was an Ottoman princess, the daughter of Sultan Abd\u00fclaziz and his wife Gevheri Kad\u0131n, herself the daughter of Salih Bey Svatnba.  She was the half-sister of Abd\u00fclmecid II, the last Caliph of the Muslim world. \n\nK\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck H\u00fcseyin Pasha (1757 \u2013 7 December 1803), also known as Tayazade Damat K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck H\u00fcseyin Pasha, was an Ottoman statesman and admiral who was Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral of the Ottoman Navy) from 11 March 1792 to 7 December 1803.  He was a \"damat\" (\"bridegroom\") to the Ottoman dynasty after he married an Ottoman princess, Esma Sultan. \n\nThe Esma Sultan Mansion (Turkish: \"Esma Sultan Yal\u0131s\u0131\" ), a historical yal\u0131 (English: waterside mansion ) located at Bosphorus in Ortak\u00f6y neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey and named after its original owner Esma Sultan, is used today as a cultural center after being redeveloped. \n\n",

The city was named for New York Governor DeWitt Clinton.  The population was 449 at the 2010 census. \n\nThe New York Society of Model Engineers (NYSME) was originally incorporated in 1926 in New York City.  There are published records that show the Society existed as early as 1905.  In its early years, the organization moved to and from various locations throughout Manhattan.  AT that time it was basically a gentlemen's club of members who were interested in all types of model building.  In 1926 the Society was formalized and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York.  This was done so that the Society could obtain a permit to use a lake in New York City's Central Park for model motor boat races.  It was also at this time that the Society began construction of its first Model Railroad \" The Union Connecting\".  Over the next twenty years, the Society moved from its original location to two other locations.  Each move doubling the size of the previous location and of course doubling the size of the model train layout.  During WW2 many Society members were called to service in the Armed Forces.  Regrettably, the largest of the layouts had to be dismantled.  The location of the layout in the basement of the Astor Building was requested for the war effort.  The dismantling was done with care, with salvaged usable materials going into scrap drives for the War effort.  As members returned after the War a new location was searched for.  This led to an invitation from the Lackawanna Railroad to move into their Passenger Terminal in Hoboken,NJ.  They had the space for what would become the largest model railroad in the world at that time.  The space?  Only the ornate waiting room for the recently discontinued ferry boats to 23rd Street in New York City.  Here the layout was built.  It was based on the Lackawanna Railroad from Hoboken to Scranton, Pa.  It was magnificent; from the scale model of the Hoboken Terminal to the soaring Delaware Water Gap.  During the early-1950s the organization moved to its current location in Carlstadt, New Jersey. \n\n",

Lending institutions could make one or more of these changes to relieve financial pressure on borrowers to prevent the condition of foreclosure.  Loan modifications have been practiced in the United States since The 2008 Crash Of The Housing Market from Washington Mutual, Chase Home Finance, Chase, JP Morgan & Chase, other contributors like MER's.  Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification. \n\nThe 2007 MasterCard Memorial Cup was played in May 2007 in Vancouver, British Columbia, at the Pacific Coliseum.

        "context": "The E.R. Hays House, also known as Bybee & Davis Funeral Home, is a historic building located in Knoxville, Iowa, United States.  Hays was a local lawyer who served briefly in the United States House of Representatives, replacing Edwin H. Conger who resigned to become the United States Ambassador to Brazil.  Hays died a year after the house was completed.  The family continued to live here until 1935 when it became the Bybee & Davis Funeral Home.  The 2\u00bd-story brick structure was designed by the Des Moines architectural firm of Foster & Liebbe in a combination of the Late Victorian and Italianate styles.  Victorian eclecticism is featured in the porch and the trimwork, while the Italianate is found in the building's massing.  The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. \n\nThe Cresco Opera House, also known as the Cresco Theater, is a historic building located in Cresco, Iowa, United States.  The first known theater in Cresco was the Lyric Hall, which opened in 1875.  It showed the first movies around 1900.  The Family and the Cozy theaters opened around the turn of the century.  The Lyric was condemned and torn down in 1913, and the other two were considered substandard.  The Cresco Commercial Club held a fundraiser in early 1914 to build an opera house.  The Cresco Opera House Company was organized around the same time.  The building was completed by the end of the year, and it opened in 1915.  It was designed by local engineer Joseph H. Howe, and constructed by local builder Martin Johnson.  The musical \"High Jinks\" was the first performance held in the theater.  The theater, which seats 425, was equipped to show movies and there was a community hall in the basement.  It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. \n\nOphur was a rock band from the Chicago suburbs in DuPage County.  The band performed in the midwestern United States over the course of seven years with national acts including The Plain White T's, Sum 41, Violent Femmes, Local H, Lucky Boys Confusion, Veruca Salt, Two Skinee J's, Duvall, Sleeping at Last, and others.  Their music has been described as an eclectic amalgamation of U2, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Pink Floyd. \n\nMendocino County, California, was the first jurisdiction in the United States to ban the cultivation, production or distribution of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).  The ordinance, entitled Measure H, was passed by referendum on March 2, 2004.  Initiated by the group \"GMO Free Mendocino\", the campaign was a highly publicized grassroots effort by local farmers and environmental groups who contend that the potential risks of GMOs to human health and the ecosystem have not yet been fully understood.  The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry, The California Plant Health Association (now the Western Plant Health Association) and CropLife America, a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation, including Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical.  Since the enactment of the ordinance, Mendocino County has been added to an international list of \"GMO free zones.\"  Pre-emptive statutes banning local municipalities from such ordinances have now become widespread with adoption in sixteen states. \n\nThe Wilford H. Fawcett House is a house in Breezy Point, Minnesota, United States, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Wilford H. Fawcett, also known as \"Captain Billy\", started the book \"Captain Billy's Whiz Bang\" as a joke book for soldiers during World War I.  He formed Fawcett Publications in 1919 in Robbinsdale, Minnesota.  In 1920, he bought a tract of land where the present-day Breezy Point Resort is located, and he began building cottages and a large log lodge.  The lodge has since burnt down.  He built the Fawcett House as a private residence within the resort property.  Fawcett hired the Minneapolis architects of Magney and Tusler and commissioned the design in the Swiss Chateau style.  The rustic log style was a bit ironic, since the local logging industry had declined before the resort was built. \n\nSuffrajett is a United States rock band from New York City, currently based in Chicago, Illinois, composed of singer/violinist Simi Sernaker, guitarist Jason Chasko, bassist Kevin Roberts, and drummer Danny Severson.  Suffrajett has toured with Local H, The Last Vegas, and Bob Schneider, and have opened for the reunited MC5.  Suffrajett released their self-titled debut album on February 2, 2003, and their latest album \"Black Glitter\" was released on January 1, 2007.  They recently toured with Juliette and the Licks and Scissors for Lefty. \n\nHallelujah!  I'm A Bum is the seventh studio album by Chicago-based rock band Local H.  Interviews with the band have revealed that it is a concept album based on politics in the United States.  Although the album was completed in spring of 2012, the band chose to release it in September as to be closer to the 2012 presidential election.  The album makes frequent use of the sounds of the El Train in Chicago to transition songs. \n\nThe William H. Cook Water Tank House is a water tank house located southeast of Jerome, Idaho, United States.  The building was constructed circa 1915 and was used to store water for William H. Cook's farm.  The rectangular building was constructed with lava rock and contains a metal tank.  Although the stone craftsmanship in the building is similar to the work of local stonemason H. T. Pugh, the builder of the house has not been determined. \n\nThe 1978 United States Senate election in Illinois took place on November 7, 1978.  Incumbent Republican United States Senator Charles H. Percy ran for re-election to a third term in the United States Senate.  Percy was opposed by Democratic nominee Alex Seith, an attorney who had been appointed to several local government positions.  Though Percy had been expected to coast to re-election over Seith, a first-time candidate, the election quickly became competitive.  In the last few days of the campaign, a desperate Percy ran a television advertisement that featured him apologizing and acknowledging that, \"I got your message and you're right.\"  Percy's last-ditch effort appeared to have paid off, as he was able to edge out Seith to win what would end up being his third and final term in the Senate. \n\nAmherst ( ) is a town in Hampshire County, Massachusetts, United States, in the Connecticut River valley.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 37,819, making it the largest municipality in Hampshire County (although the county seat is Northampton).  The town is home to Amherst College, Hampshire College, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, three of the Five Colleges.  The name of the town is pronounced without the \"h\" (\"AM-erst\"), giving rise to the local saying, \"only the 'h' is silent\", in reference both to the pronunciation and to the town's politically active populace. \n\n",

        "context": "The history of the Kansas City metropolitan area begins in the 19th century as Frenchmen from St. Louis, Missouri moved up the Missouri River to trap for furs and trade with the Native Americans.  The Kansas City metropolitan area, straddling the border between Missouri and Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, was a strategic point for commerce and security.  Kansas City, Missouri was founded in 1838 and defeated its rival Westport to become the predominant city west of St. Louis.  The area played a major role in the westward expansion of the United States.  The Santa Fe, and Oregon trails ran through the area.  In 1854, when Kansas was opened to Euro-American settlement, the Missouri-Kansas border became the first battlefield in the conflict in the American Civil War. \n\nThe University of the Incarnate Word (UIW) is a private Catholic university whose main campus is located in San Antonio and Alamo Heights, Texas, United States.  Founded in 1881 by the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, the university's main campus is located on 154 acre . \n\nThe Federal University of Para\u00edba (Portuguese: \"Universidade Federal da Para\u00edba\" , UFPB) is a public university whose main campus is located in the city of Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba, Brazil.  Together with the Federal University of Campina Grande, it is the main university of the state of Paraiba, Brazil. \n\nThe Kansas City metropolitan area is a 15-county metropolitan area anchored by Kansas City, Missouri, that straddles the border between the U.S. states of Missouri and Kansas.  With a population of about 2,340,000, it ranks as the second largest metropolitan area with its core in Missouri (after Greater St. Louis).  Alongside Kansas City, the area includes a number of other cities and suburbs, the largest being Overland Park, Kansas; Kansas City, Kansas; Olathe, Kansas; and Independence, Missouri; each over 100,000 in population.  The Mid-America Regional Council (MARC) serves as the Council of Governments and the Metropolitan Planning Organization for the area. \n\nThe University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City (UMKC) is a public research university serving the greater Kansas City metropolitan area.  Located in Kansas City, Missouri, UMKC is one of four system campuses that collectively constitute the University of Missouri.  UMKC is spread across multiple locales; the main Volker Campus, home to the majority of university operations, is located in Kansas City's Rockhill neighborhood, east of the Country Club Plaza, and adjacent to both the Stowers Institute for Medical Research and the world-renowned Linda Hall Library.  In 2017 the University, in collaboration with Truman Medical Center, Children's Mercy Hospital, the Missouri Health Department, the Jackson County Medical Examiners Office, and the Missouri Department of Mental Health Behavioral Medicine, formed the UMKC Health Sciences District on Hospital Hill.  This district is a first-in-the-nation partnership between local and state governments, the university, and these nationally recognized healthcare faculties, designed to promote collaboration in research, innovation, education, grant funding, and community outreach, for the advancement of health and wellness in the greater Kansas City metropolitan area.  Also in 2017, the university announced plans to expand its metropolitan identity with the construction of a downtown Campus for the Arts, located near the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts.  The university's enrollment as of 2015 exceeded more than 16,600 students. \n\nDowntown Kansas City is the central business district (CBD) of Kansas City, Missouri and the Kansas City metropolitan area.  It is between the Missouri River in the north, to 31st Street in the south; and from the Kansas\u2013Missouri state line east to Bruce R. Watkins Drive as defined by the Downtown Council of Kansas City; the 2010 Greater Downtown Area Plan formulated by the City of Kansas City defines the Greater Downtown Area to be the city limits of North Kansas City and Missouri to the north, the Kansas\u2013Missouri state line to the west, 31st Street to the south and Woodland Avenue to the east.  However, the definition used by the Downtown Council is the most commonly accepted. \n\nThe University of Kansas, often referred to as KU or Kansas, is a public research university in the U.S. state of Kansas.  The main campus in Lawrence, one of the largest college towns in Kansas, is on Mount Oread, the highest elevation in Lawrence.  Two branch campuses are in the Kansas City metropolitan area: the Edwards Campus in Overland Park, and the university's medical school and hospital in Kansas City.  There are also educational and research sites in Parsons, Topeka, Garden City, Hays, and Leavenworth, and branches of the medical school in Wichita and Salina.  The university is one of the 62 members of the Association of American Universities. \n\nKansas City jazz is a style of jazz that developed in Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri and the surrounding Kansas City Metropolitan Area during the 1930s and marked the transition from the structured big band style to the musical improvisation style of Bebop.  The hard-swinging, bluesy transition style is bracketed by Count Basie who in 1929 signed with the Bennie Moten's Kansas City Orchestra and Kansas City native Charlie Parker who was to usher in the Bebop style in the 1940s.  According to a Kansas City website, \"While New Orleans was the birthplace of jazz, America's music grew up in Kansas City\".  Kansas City is known as one of the most popular \"cradles of jazz\".  Other cities include New Orleans, Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and New York City. \n\nNorth Kansas City is a city in Clay County, Missouri, United States that despite the similarity in name to its larger counterpart, Kansas City, is an independent municipality part of the Kansas City metropolitan area.  The population was 4,208 at the 2010 census.  Originally a northern suburb across the Missouri River from Kansas City, Missouri, it is now almost completely surrounded by Kansas City, which has annexed far to the north of North Kansas City's northern city limits.  North Kansas City also adjoins the small municipality of Avondale. \n\nKansas City Scout is one of the United States' largest electronic traffic management systems.  It was created in 2000 as part of a bi-state initiative between the Missouri Department of Transportation and the Kansas Department of Transportation to provide this system for the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, which is in both Missouri and Kansas (the anchor city of Kansas City is in Missouri).  The project's cost was $43 million.  Of that amount, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contributed 80-90 percent of the project cost.  KDOT and MoDOT shared the remaining cost.  The system employs a system of electronic boards placed on major highways throughout the metropolitan area that display traffic information whenever information needs to be displayed (due to an accident, lane closure, highway closure etc.), and the system also has cameras on those billboards to automatically detect traffic problems.  While the system has extensive coverage of highways in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area it still has much more to cover.  Since it would be too expensive to cover all the major highways in the Kansas City metro (which has more miles of highway per person than any other metropolitan area in the United States), studies were conducted to determine which highways or segments of highways have priority due to higher accident rates.  Since the project's beginning, it has expanded greatly, and will continue to expand.  Future plans are to extend coverage to I-635 and cover I-435 even more (especially in the northern areas of the metro) as well as other major city highways.  It was named after the iconic Kansas City Scout Statue that exists in Penn Valley Park, overlooking Downtown Kansas City. \n\n",

Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called \"Great Recession\" of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created \"Watch Dog\" like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification. \n\n888 7th Avenue is a 628\u00a0ft (191m) tall modern-style office skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan which was completed in 1969 and has 46 floors.

United finished the season by becoming the first English team to win the Double (league title and FA Cup) twice.  Their triumph was made all the more remarkable by the fact that Alex Ferguson had sold experienced players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes and Andrei Kanchelskis before the start of the season, and not made any major signings.  Instead, he had drafted in young players like Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers, Gary and Phil. \n\nSir Alexander Chapman Ferguson, CBE (born 31 December 1941) is a Scottish former football manager and player who managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013.

Castelmary also appeared at opera houses in England and the United States, and died onstage at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, during a performance of \"Martha\" by Friedrich von Flotow. \n\nGiuseppe Verdi is a 1938 Italian biographical film directed by Carmine Gallone and starring Fosco Giachetti, Gaby Morlay and Germana Paolieri.  The film portrays the life of the composer Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901).  The casting of Giachetti as Verdi was intended to emphasise the composer's patriotism, as he had recently played patriotic roles in films such as \"The White Squadron\".  The film was made at the Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios in Rome.  The film is also known by the alternative title The Life of Giuseppe Verdi. \n\nThe Giuseppe Verdi Monument is a sculpture in honor of composer Giuseppe Verdi located in Verdi Square Park (between West 72nd and West 73rd streets, between Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway) in Manhattan, New York City.  The statue, by Pasquale Civiletti (1858\u20131952), depicts Verdi flanked by four of his most popular characters: Falstaff (on the west side of the statue of Verdi), Leonora of \"La forza del destino\" (south side), Aida (north side), and Otello (east side). \n\nFerdinando Angelo Maria Provesi (1770 \u2013 1833) was a native of Parma, Italy.  He was regarded as one of the greatest Italian opera composers of the era .  Provesi is best known as being an early tutor of Giuseppe Verdi when he was the \"Maestro di cappella\" (master of music) at the St. Bartolomeo cathedral in Busseto (the town very close to Le Roncole, the village where Verdi was born.)  Provesi was also director of the municipal music school and local Philharmonic Society.  He began teaching Verdi in 1824 when the future composer was 11 years old. \n\nBernhard B\u00f6tel (1883\u20131953) was a German operatic tenor and actor who had an active career in Germany and Austria during the first half of the 20th century.  He made recordings for several record labels during the early years of the recording industry, including His Master's Voice, Odeon Records, Polydor Records, Tri-Ergon, and Vox Records.  On the stage he sang a variety of roles in operas and operettas from leading parts to comprimario roles.  His stage repertoire included Belmonte in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's \"Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail\", Chapelou in Adolphe Adam's \"Le postillon de Lonjumeau\", Count Almaviva in Gioachino Rossini's \"The Barber of Seville\", Daniel in Franz Leh\u00e1r's \"The Merry Widow\", the Duke of Mantua in Giuseppe Verdi's \"Rigoletto\", Gabriel von Eisenstein in Johann Strauss II's \"Die Fledermaus\", Indigo in Strauss' \"Indigo und die vierzig R\u00e4uber\", Jen\u00edk in Bed\u0159ich Smetana's \"The Bartered Bride\", Paolino in Domenico Cimarosa's \"Il matrimonio segreto\", P\u00e2ris in Jacques Offenbach's \"La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\", Pietro in Franz von Supp\u00e9's \"Boccaccio\", and Wilhelm Meister in Ambroise Thomas' \"Mignon\". \n\nThis list provides a guide to opera composers, as determined by their presence on a majority of compiled lists of significant opera composers.  (See the \"Lists Consulted\" section for full details.)  The composers run from Jacopo Peri, who wrote the first ever opera in late 16th century Italy, to John Adams, one of the leading figures in the contemporary operatic world.  The brief accompanying notes offer an explanation as to why each composer has been considered major.  Also included is a section about major women opera composers, compiled from the same lists.  For an introduction to operatic history, see opera.  The organisation of the list is by birthdate. \n\n",

The daughter of Dr. Hamilton Osgood and Margaret Cushing Osgood of Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts, her younger sister was Mary Alden Childers, the wife of writer and Irish nationalist Robert Erskine Childers.  Her nephew Erskine Hamilton Childers served as the fourth President of Ireland from 1973-74. \n\nThe R509 road, following part of the Childers Road (named after Erskine Childers), is a regional road in Ireland, running through the southeastern side of Limerick City.  It forms what is somewhat akin to an inner ring road (albeit mostly two-lane only). \n\nErskine Barton Childers (11 March 1929 \u2013 25 August 1996) was an Irish writer, BBC correspondent and United Nations senior civil servant.  He was the eldest son of Erskine Hamilton Childers (Ireland's fourth President) and Ruth Ellen Dow Childers.  His grandparents Mary Alden Childers and Robert Erskine Childers and the latter's double first cousin Robert Barton were all Irish nationalists involved heavily with the negotiation of Irish independence; which ultimately led to his grandfather's execution during the Irish Civil War.  His great aunt was Gretchen Osgood Warren. \n\nRobert Caesar Childers (1838 \u2013 25 July 1876) was a British Orientalist scholar, compiler of the first P\u0101li-English dictionary.  Childers was the husband of Anna Barton of Ireland.  He was the father of Irish nationalist Robert Erskine Childers and grandfather to the fourth President of Ireland, Erskine Hamilton Childers. \n\nRobert Erskine Childers DSC (25 June 1870 \u2013 24 November 1922), universally known as Erskine Childers, was a British writer, whose works included the influential novel \"The Riddle of the Sands\", and a Fenian revolutionary who smuggled guns to Ireland in his sailing yacht \"Asgard\".  He was executed by the authorities of the nascent Irish Free State during the Irish Civil War.  He was the son of British Orientalist scholar Robert Caesar Childers; the cousin of Hugh Childers and Robert Barton; and the father of the fourth President of Ireland, Erskine Hamilton Childers. \n\nAsgard is a 51 ft gaff rigged yacht.  She was owned by the English-born writer and Irish nationalist Erskine Childers and his wife Molly Childers.  She is most noted for her use in the Howth gun-running of 1914. \n\nRobert Childers Barton (4 March 1881 \u2013 10 August 1975) was an Irish nationalist, politician and farmer who participated in the negotiations leading up to the signature of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.  His father was Charles William Barton and his mother was Agnes Childers.  His wife was Rachel Warren of Boston, daughter of Fiske Warren.  His double first cousin and close friend was Robert Erskine Childers. \n\nThe Riddle of the Sands is a 1979 English spy thriller cinema film based upon the novel of the same name written by Erskine Childers.

Although Tigger's birthday is believed to be in October 1928, the year that \"The House at Pooh Corner\" was first published, on Tigger-related merchandise, Disney often indicates Tigger's birth year as 1968, a reference to the first year that Tigger appeared in a Disney production, \"Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day\".

The song is repeated in Disney's 1974 release \"Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too! \", The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride and then again in the 1977 release \"The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh\".  \"The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers\" opens up the 2000 release of \"The Tigger Movie\".

        "context": "The Siri Remote is a remote control device released in tandem with the 4th Generation Apple TV at an Apple Keynote Address by CEO Tim Cook on October 26, 2015 by Apple Inc. The Remote is designed specifically to work with the always-on Siri capable Apple TV.  The device is a successor of the original Apple Remote.  It is also compatible with the Apple TV 4K. \n\nThe Apple Remote is a remote control device released in or after October 2005 by Apple Inc. for use with a number of its products which use infrared capabilities.  The device was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers.  The first three generations of Apple TV used the Apple Remote as their primary control mechanism.  It has now been replaced with the Siri Remote in the fourth generation.  Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple produced several nameless IR remotes for products such as the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive. \n\nNetSupport Manager is a Windows-centric cross-platform remote control software, allowing remote screen control and systems management from a Windows or Windows Mobile device of Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris and Mobile devices.  It was first released for DOS only networks in 1989.  It supports thumbnail display of unlimited remote systems (since version 10), and allows navigation between remote systems in a manner similar to a KVM switch.  Functionality includes file transfers, chat, and hardware/software inventory including software updates. Fewer features are supported for Linux and Mac clients.  In 2012 NetSupport introduced new software versions allowing Remote Control from iOS and Android tablets and smartphones as well as a new Mac OS Control.  Version 12 was released in October 2013, which extended platform support to include ChromeOS clients.  Mobile Remote Control from iOS and Android was also extended with additional capabilities.  All versions of NetSupport Manager require the pre-installation of the software on both the local (Control) and remote (Client) computers/devices prior to use. \n\nIn electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance.  For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance.  A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls.  In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. \n\nFront Row is a discontinued media center software application for Apple's Macintosh computers and Apple TV for navigating and viewing video, photos, podcasts, and music from a computer, optical disc, or the Internet through a 10-foot user interface (similar to Windows Media Center and Kodi).  The software relies on iTunes and iPhoto and is controlled by an Apple Remote or the keyboard function keys.  The first version was released October 2005, with two major revisions since.  Front Row was removed and discontinued in Mac OS X 10.7. \n\nA universal remote is a remote control that can be programmed to operate various brands of one or more types of consumer electronics devices.  Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote.  Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allow the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with.  For example, a VCR remote may be programmed to operate various brands of televisions. \n\nMacScan is an anti-malware utility for Apple's Mac OS X developed by SecureMac.  It is aimed at removing malware (including spyware, Trojan horses, keystroke loggers, and tracking cookies).  It was the first anti-spyware program released for Mac OS X.  In addition, the application scans for remote administration programs, like Apple Remote Desktop, allowing users to verify that such programs are installed only with their authorization. \n\nApple Remote Desktop (ARD) is a Macintosh application produced by Apple Inc., first released on March 14, 2002, that replaced a similar product called \"Apple Network Assistant\".  Aimed at computer administrators responsible for large numbers of computers and teachers who need to assist individuals or perform group demonstrations, Apple Remote Desktop allows users to remotely control or monitor other computers over a network. \n\nApple Watch (stylized as \uf8ffWATCH) is a line of smartwatches developed, designed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities with integration with iOS and other Apple products and services.  The original generation of the device was available in four variants: Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, Apple Watch Herm\u00e8s, and Apple Watch Edition; each distinguished by different combinations of cases and first- or third-party interchangeable bands.  Apple Watch relies on a wirelessly connected iPhone to perform many of its default functions such as calling and texting.  It is compatible with the iPhone 5 or later models running iOS 8.2 or later, through the use of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  Announced by Apple CEO Tim Cook in September 2014, the device was released in April 24, 2015.  The Apple Watch quickly became the best-selling wearable device with the supply of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of the 2015 fiscal year.  The second generation of Apple Watch, released in September 2016, includes two tiers: Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Series 1, which includes the S1P chip, but is otherwise identical to the original.  The Series 3 was announced at a presentation at Apple Park on September 12, 2017 and was released on September 22, 2017. \n\nTrainmaster Command (TMCC) is Lionel's electronic control system for O scale 3-rail model trains and toy trains that mainly ran from 1994 to 2006.  Conceptually it is similar to Digital Command Control (DCC), the industry's open standard used by HO scale and other 2-rail DC trains.  It has one advantage over DCC, in that TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives and Lionel Legacy engines as well as LionChief and LionChief Plus equipped locomotives.  The latter require a dedicated remote controller.  MTH Corporation's DCS controller can be configured to control TMCC locomotives, and all four systems (TMCC, Legacy, LionChief/LionChief+ and DCS) can be operated on the same track simultaneously.  Each simply requires a constant track voltage (18 volts).  TMCC/Legacy \"broadcasts\" it's signal to the antenna on the locomotives which listen for signals that first identify the particular locomotive by number and then it issues given commands as to speed, direction, sounds, lighting and other features.  DCS performs similar functions but transmits a carrier over the rails which are picked up through the locomotive's electrical pickup contacts.  While TMCC/Legacy and DCS remote controls relay operator commands to a device that transmits them to the train (Command Base or Track Interface Unit), LionChief/LionChief+ also issue remote control commands but the remote and locomotive are married and each locomotive requires a separate remote control.  This system requires no additional wiring as the control is directly \"narrowcast\" to the locomotive in the same way as a television remote control or garage door opener functions.  In 2017, Lionel released a universal remote for LionChief+ that will learn addresses for up to three locos at a time, simplifying the operation of multiple trains. \n\n",

        "context": "The discography of English alternative music singer/songwriter Badly Drawn Boy (real name Damon Gough) includes eight studio albums (including two soundtracks), one compilation, six extended plays and twenty-one singles.  The first EP and several singles were released on Gough's own label \"Twisted Nerve\", which he started with like-minded Manchester musician Andy Votel.  Badly Drawn Boy rose in popularity in 1997 when he joined the likes of Thom Yorke, Richard Ashcroft, and Mike D on the celebrity-filled UNKLE album \"Psyence Fiction\".  Due to the mild UK chart success of the 1999 single \"Once Around the Block\", XL Recordings signed up Badly Drawn Boy to release the debut album \"The Hour of Bewilderbeast\" in 2000.  The album won critical praise and Britain's acclaimed Mercury Prize for Best Album.  The album caught the attention of author Nick Hornby who then asked Gough to score the film being made for his book \"About a Boy\". \n\nSoulfire came at a time when Tom Hingley (ex-frontman of Inspiral Carpets) was at an all-time low contemplating his career, the future and having doubts that he was good enough to make a stab at a solo career.  Damon Gough (aka Badly Drawn Boy) persuaded Tom that you've just got to follow that gut instinct and go for what you believe in.  After the release of the critically acclaimed solo acoustic 2000 album, Keep Britain Untidy, this return to a full band rock album allowed a base to build on and showed off the voice that had been hidden amongst the Inspiral's trademark organ sound. \n\n\"Something to Talk About\" is a song by British musical artist Badly Drawn Boy from About a Boy.  It was released as a single on 30 July 2002.  It peaked at number 28 on the UK Singles Chart. \n\nUnder an Hour is the second full-length album from Portland-based experimental pop/rock group Menomena.  The album was originally composed and performed as accompaniment for a performance by Portland dance company Monster Squad.  Consisting of three instrumental tracks, the album is considered to be an experimental soundtrack along the lines of Peter Gabriel's or Badly Drawn Boy's soundtrack for \"About a Boy\". \n\nCraig Davies is an English singer/songwriter from Manchester, who was active from 1988 to 1990 and release two albums on the Rough Trade music label.  He was at one point vocalist for the band Easterhouse but left after signing a solo deal with Rough Trade.  He has also collaborated with Vini Reilly, Ben Watt and Badly Drawn Boy. \n\n\"Silent Sigh\" is a single by British musical artist Badly Drawn Boy from the soundtrack to the film \"About a Boy\".  It reached number 16 in the UK Singles Chart. \n\nAbout a Boy is the second album by English singer-songwriter Badly Drawn Boy, released in 2002 under Twisted Nerve Records and XL Recordings, and in America under the short-lived ARTISTdirect Records, as the soundtrack to the film \"About a Boy\".  Gough was chosen to compose and perform the entire soundtrack. \n\nThe Hour of Bewilderbeast is the debut studio album by British musician Badly Drawn Boy, released on 26 June 2000.  Damon Gough, who performs as Badly Drawn Boy, wrote, produced, and played several instruments on the album's eighteen tracks, several of which also feature accompaniment by members of the British indie rock bands Alfie and Doves.  \"The Hour of Bewilderbeast\" was released to great critical acclaim and went on to win the 2000 Mercury Prize, and has sold 455,000 copies in the United Kingdom as of September 2011. \n\nAbout a Boy is a 2002 British-American-French comedy-drama film produced by Jane Rosenthal, Robert De Niro, Brad Epstein, Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, co-written and directed by brothers Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz with music by Badly Drawn Boy and written by Peter Hedges.  It is an adaptation of the 1998 novel of the same name by Nick Hornby.  The film stars are Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette, and Rachel Weisz.  The film at times uses double voice-over narration, when the audience hears both Will's and Marcus's thoughts. \n\nTom Rothrock is an international record producer, composer, musician and owner of Bong Load Records.  Tom Rothrock has worked with James Blunt, Foo Fighters, Moby, Beck, Badly Drawn Boy, R. L. Burnside, Athlete, Sloan, Gwen Stefani, Mot\u00f6rhead, Elbow, Stevie Nicks, Poison, Elliott Smith, Richard Thompson, Yonder Mountain String Band.  Rothrock has also composed or contributed to soundtracks for notable motion pictures such as \"About A Boy\", \"Good Will Hunting\", \"Collateral\" and \"The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie\". \n\n",

The film is based on the 1992 UEFA European Football Championship, Denmark's greatest ever football triumph.  The team had qualified only after Yugoslavia was disqualified as a result of the breakup and warfare in that country.  The film examines the often difficult relationship between the team's coach Richard M\u00f8ller Nielsen, and the Danish Football Association and leading players that nonetheless led to triumph in 1992. \n\nEdson Arantes do Nascimento (] ; born 23 October 1940), known as Pel\u00e9 (] ), is a retired Brazilian professional footballer who played as a forward.  He is widely regarded as the greatest football player of all time.  In 1999, he was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS).  That same year, Pel\u00e9 was elected Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee.  According to the IFFHS, Pel\u00e9 is the most successful league goal-scorer in the world, scoring 1281 goals in 1363 games, which included unofficial friendlies and tour games.

Their only serious rivals were the K\u0119sgailos, and from the end of the 15th century the fast rising in power and influence Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family clan.

Most power family gained during the reign of Casimir Jagiellon.  The castaldius of Vytautas, Andrius Go\u0161tautas might have been a voivode of Vilnius and Kreva, and father of Jonas, appears to have been the precursor of the family growth.

At the time of his death, he had been held for three days at the US base 10 miles south of Asadabad, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, on suspicion of involvement in a rocket attack on the same base.  The cause of his death was at first reported to be a heart attack, but this came into question when three members of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division came forward to testify that CIA contractor David Passaro assaulted Wali.  Passaro, a former U.S. Army Ranger, allegedly beat Wali for two consecutive nights, causing grievous injuries including a fractured pelvis.  Prosecutors would charge that Passaro ordered soldiers not to allow Wali to sleep, limited his access to food and water and subjected him to two consecutive nights of interrogation and beatings.  Among other injuries, Wali suffered a suspected fractured pelvis that would have made it impossible for him to urinate.  Witnesses testified that during one session Passaro, while wearing combat boots, kicked Wali in the groin hard enough to lift him off the ground, threw Wali to the ground, beat Wali on the arms and legs with a heavy Maglite flashlight, and that Passaro also vigorously thrust a flashlight into Wali's abdomen.  After the second night of beatings, Wali begged the soldiers to kill him and moaned a phrase that meant, \"I'm dying.\"  Wali died on his fourth day in custody.  He repeatedly denied any involvement in the rocket attacks. \n\nThe Twenty-fifth Anniversary Anthology is a compilation album released by The Fixx in 2006 in celebration of their 25th anniversary.

To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion.  The genus is considered close to the genera \"Stapelia\" and \"Hoodia\".

At its peak during World War II, NYSB was the largest and most productive shipyard in the world.  Its best-known vessels include the destroyer  , the cruiser  , the aircraft carrier  , the nuclear-powered cargo ship NS \"Savannah\", and a quartet of cargo-passenger liners nicknamed the \"Four Aces\". \n\nThe Kaiser Shipyards were seven major shipbuilding yards located on the United States west coast during World War II.  Kaiser ranked 20th among U.S. corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.  The shipyards were owned by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, a creation of American industrialist Henry J. Kaiser, (1882-1967), who established the shipbuilding company around 1939 in order to help meet the construction goals set by the United States Maritime Commission for merchant shipping. \n\nThe Eagle Mountain Railroad (EMRR) was a private railroad in California, owned by the Kaiser Steel Corporation, and is owned today by Kaiser Steel's successor, Kaiser Ventures, Inc. of Ontario, California. \n\nNutri Ventures (also known as Nutri Ventures \u2013 The Quest for the 7 Kingdoms) (Portuguese: Nutri Ventures - Em Busca dos 7 Reinos) is a Portuguese TV series produced by the Nutri Ventures Corporation that is distributed through Hulu Kids. \n\nEdgar Fosburgh Kaiser Sr. (July 29, 1908 \u2013 December 7, 1981) was an American industrialist, who was Chairman of Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation, the Kaiser Cement Corporation and the Kaiser Steel Corporation. \n\nKaiser Ventures (formerly Kaiser Steel) corporation, headquartered in Ontario, California.  It was founded by Henry J. Kaiser to provide steel plate for the Pacific Coast shipbuilding industry, which expanded during World War II, then shrank, then expanded again during the Korean War.  California Shipbuilding Corporation on Terminal Island, California, was one of these shipyards which built hundreds of Liberty ships and Victory ships in World War II, and was also a project of Henry Kaiser.  Kaiser Steel was noted for making the most of its costly steelmaking inputs, and it captured, along with the U.S. Steel plant in Utah, much of the Pacific Coast steel market by the late 1950s.  Its assets included steelmaking plants in Napa, California (that it acquired from Basalt Rock Company in 1955) and Fontana, California (now operated by California Steel Industries), and a former open-pit iron ore mine at Eagle Mountain, California.  Steel manufactured was also used in Kaiser Motors. \n\nJohn Roach & Sons was a major 19th-century American shipbuilding and manufacturing firm founded in 1864 by Irish-American immigrant John Roach.  Between 1871 and 1885, the company was the largest shipbuilding firm in the United States, building more iron ships than its next two major competitors combined.  It was also by far the largest contractor to the U.S. Navy during this period, and at its peak is said to have been the nation's largest employer behind the railroads. \n\nNeafie, Levy & Co., commonly known as Neafie & Levy, was a Philadelphia shipbuilding and engineering firm that existed from the middle of the 19th to the beginning of the 20th century.  Described as America's \"first specialist marine engineers\", Neafie & Levy was probably the first company in the United States to combine the building of iron ships with the manufacture of steam engines to power them.  The company was also the largest supplier of screw propellers to other North American shipbuilding firms in its early years, and at its peak in the early 1870s was Philadelphia's busiest and most heavily capitalized shipbuilder. \n\nEdgar Fosburgh Kaiser Jr. (July 5, 1942 \u2013 January 11, 2012) was an American-Canadian financier and a former owner of the Denver Broncos American football team.  He was born in Portland, Oregon on July 5, 1942 and is the grandson of shipbuilding industrialist Henry J. Kaiser.  He earned a BA degree from Stanford University and an MBA degree from Harvard University.  Kaiser served as a White House Fellow and as a Special Assistant to President Lyndon B. Johnson, President Richard M. Nixon, and as a Special Assistant to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Walter J. Hickel.  He became a Canadian citizen in 1980.  He died on January 11, 2012. \n\nHenry John Kaiser (May 9, 1882 \u2013 August 24, 1967) was an American industrialist who became known as the father of modern American shipbuilding.  He established the Kaiser Shipyards, which built Liberty ships during World War II, after which he formed Kaiser Aluminum and Kaiser Steel.  Kaiser organized Kaiser Permanente health care for his workers and their families.  He led Kaiser-Frazer followed by Kaiser Motors, automobile companies known for the safety of their designs.  Kaiser was involved in large construction projects such as civic centers and dams, and invested in real estate.  With his wealth, he established the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit, non-partisan, charitable organization. \n\n",

The second modern role-playing game published, it was written by Ken St. Andre to be a more accessible alternative to \"Dungeons & Dragons\" and is suitable for solitaire, group, and play-by-mail gameplay. \n\nMercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes (\"MSPE\") is a tabletop role-playing game designed and written by Michael A. Stackpole and first published in April 1983 by Blade, a division of Flying Buffalo, Inc.  A second edition was later published by Sleuth Publications, but Flying Buffalo continues to distribute the game.  \"MSPE\"'s mechanics are based on those of \"Tunnels and Trolls\", with the addition of a skill system for characters.  A few adventure modules were also released for \"MSPE\".  The ruleset of 1987 video game \"Wasteland\", on which Michael A. Stackpole worked, is based on \"MSPE\"; as the upcoming 2013 sequel \"Wasteland 2\" will use similar mechanics, so it too can be seen as based on MSPE. \n\nCrank Caverns is the common name of the remains of the Rainford Delph Quarry near Crank in St. Helens, Merseyside.  It is a network of underground tunnels and caverns, as well as an extensive woodland.  Information in the St. Helens local history archives states that sandstone quarrying began here as early as 1730.  As the quarry expanded, the cost of purchasing land to open cast mine it increased, so it was decided to opt for a different method.  Instead of quarrying out the stone, they would mine it out, following a seam of stone until it ran out.  This resulted in the network of caves, tunnels and shafts we see today.  Rainford Delph is listed as a Colliery by 1854, under the ownership of Charles Howarth or Yorkshire Charlie as he was known locally by 1880.  Mining finally ceased and the woods and caverns were used as a game reserve by the Earl of Derby until 1939, when they became a storage facility for ammunition for the anti-aircraft position at Crank.  After the war, the caverns ceased use as a game reserve.  Today, Crank Caverns are not officially open to the public and due to their increasing instability, attempts have been made to close access to the caverns and tunnels themselves.  Despite this, the site is still physically accessible from a nearby public footpath and is still a draw for generations of curious locals who wish to explore, many having heard the numerous local myths and legends from an early age. \n\nJon St. Andre (born December 8, 1939 in Ishpeming, Michigan) is an American former ski jumper who competed in the 1960 Winter Olympics. \n\nSt. Andre Vidhan Sabha Constituency is one of the 40 Goa Legislative Assembly constituencies of the state of Goa in southern India.  St. Andre is also one of the 20 constituencies falling under the North Goa Lok Sabha constituency. \n\nCrusaders of Khazan is a computer adaptation of the tabletop role-playing game \"Tunnels and Trolls\", developed and published by New World Computing in 1990 for the PC, FM Towns, PC-88 and PC-98.  The game is available from Flying Buffalo and in Fiery Dragon's \"Tunnels and Trolls 30th Anniversary Edition\". \n\nJim St. Andre is a retired U.S. soccer goalkeeper.  He played professionally in the American Professional Soccer League, National Professional Soccer League and Major League Soccer. \n\nStarfaring is a science fiction role-playing game created by Ken St. Andre and published by Flying Buffalo in August 1976. \n\nSt. Andre's Parish is a former parish of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland, located Biddeford, Maine.  The parish was founded in 1860 to serve the city's large French-Canadian and French-American communities.  On July 1, 2008, St. Andres was merged into the newly formed Good Shepherd Parish, made up of Saint Joseph's Church in Biddeford, Saint Mary's Church in Biddeford, Most Holy Trinity Church in Saco, Notre Dame Church in Saco, Saint Margaret's Church in Old Orchard Beach, Saint Lukes in Old Orchard Beach, Saint Brendan's in Biddeford Pool,and St. Phillip's Church in Lyman.  Of those 8 Churches, only Saint Joseph, Most Holy Trinity, Saint Margaret, and Saint Philip remain open.  (St. Brendan's has always, and continues to serve as a summer chapel.)  The parish complex of four buildings, including the church, rectory, convent, and school, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015, at which time most of it stood vacant. \n\nKenneth Eugene St. Andre (born on April 28, 1947 in Ogden, Utah) is an American fantasy author and game designer, best known for his work with \"Tunnels & Trolls\" and \"Wasteland\".

        "context": "Greatest Hits is a compilation album by American recording artist Dan Fogelberg.  It included two previously unreleased tracks, \"Missing You\" and \"Make Love Stay\", both of which were released as singles and peaked at chart positions #23 and #29 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart, respectively.  Both of the new songs made the Top 10 on the adult contemporary chart, with \"Missing You\" rising to #6 and \"Make Love Stay\" becoming the singer's third #1 on the AC chart. \n\nMake Love Not War is the 2004 debut album by Australian alternative rock band Cosmic Nomads recorded in Sydney, New South Wales at Damien Gerard Studios.  Cosmic Nomads worked with renowned engineer Russell Pilling who, with 25 years experience, has recorded The Vines, The Church (band), The Cruel Sea (band) and Jon Stevens.  A single and music video of the same name were released and distributed by MGM Sydney prior to the album release.  Pilling said \"Make Love Not War\" \"is a grower, once you listen to it a few times you begin to appreciate what it means\". \n\n\"Make Love\" is a song performed by American recording artist and songwriter Keri Hilson.  It was written by Jamal \"Polow da Don\" Jones, Ester Dean and Jason Perry, and produced by Polow da Don and Perry for Hilson's debut studio album, \"In a Perfect World...\" (2009).  The song was sent for urban adult contemporary airplay on June\u00a023, 2009 as the fifth single from the album.  Musically, \"Make Love\" is a downtempo R&B ballad.  The song received mixed reviews from music critics; some of them criticized its long length and Hilson's vocals, while others named it one of the album's standouts. \n\n\"I Just Want to Make Love to You\" is a 1954 blues song written by Willie Dixon, first recorded by Muddy Waters, and released as \"Just Make Love to Me\" (Chess 1571).  The song reached number four on \"Billboard\" magazine's R&B Best Sellers chart. \n\nMind If We Make Love to You is an album by the American power pop group Wondermints.  It was released in 2002 on record label Smile Records.  The unusual album title, with its intentional lack of punctuation, is a take-off of \"Mind If I Make Love to You\", an album of 1950s cocktail instrumentals in Darian Sahanaja's record collection. \n\nChuck Berry on Stage is an album by Chuck Berry, released in 1963 by Chess Records.  Although promoted as a live album, it is a collection of previously released studio recordings (except for 5 songs...\"All Aboard\", \"Trick or Treat\", \"I Just Want To Make Love To You\", \"Still Got The Blues\", and a previously unreleased alternate take of \"Brown-Eyed Handsome Man\") with overdubbed audience sounds to simulate a live recording.  One track on the album labelled \"Surfin' USA\", is \"Sweet Little Sixteen\", originally released in 1958, the melody of which was used in The Beach Boys' 1963 hit \"Surfin' USA\".  Chuck's cover of Willie Dixon's \"I Just Want To Make Love To You\" was later re-recorded and released on the very rare Chess LP CH60032 \"Chuck Berry\" in 1975. \n\n\"All I Wanna Do Is Make Love to You\" is a song by the rock band Heart.  It was composed by veteran songwriter and producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange and released as the lead single from the band's tenth studio album, \"Brigade\", as well as their first hit single of the 1990s.  The song was first recorded as \"All I Want to Do Is Make Love to You\" by Dobie Gray in 1979, though with different lyrics. \n\n\"Be the One\" is a power ballad by American rock band Poison.  The song was released as the second single from their 2000 \"Crack a Smile...and More! \" album.  The single/sampler was released in February 2000 and featured five b-sides including the first single from the album \"Shut Up, Make Love\" and the four unplugged bonus tracks from the album: \"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\", \"Talk Dirty to Me\", \"Your Mama Don't Dance\" and \"Something to Believe In\". \n\n\"The Longer We Make Love\" is a song recorded by American singer Barry White for his 1999 album, \"Staying Power\".  It was written by White, Aaron Schroeder and Marlon Saunders, and produced by White and Jack Perry.  The song was recorded in two versions: as a duet with Lisa Stansfield and as another duet with Chaka Khan.  Both versions are in the key of G minor and received positive reviews from music critics.  The CD single was released in selected European countries on July 19, 1999.  \"The Longer We Make Love\" was also issued as a promotional single in the United States.  The song failed to make any impact on the charts. \n\n\"Shut Up, Make Love\" is a song by American rock band Poison; released in 2000, it was the first single presented to radio stations from their 2000 \"Crack a Smile...and More! \" album.  The song also appears on the second promo single \"Be the One\" as a B-side.  \"Crack a Smile\" is Poison's fifth studio album, released on March 14, 2000, and charting at #131 on The Billboard 200.  The song was the first Poison single with lead guitarist Blues Saraceno. \n\n",

        "context": "Skyscraper National Park is the third album by Canadian singer-songwriter Hayden.  It was released on Hardwood Records in Canada, on Badman Recording Co. in the U.S., on Loose Music in the U.K., and on Massive!  in the Japan.  There were two limited-edition pressings of this album.  The first, comprising only 100 copies, was mainly for Hayden's friends and family.  The second, comprising 1,500 copies, was sold on Hayden's cross-Canada tour. \n\nAtsushi Sakurai (\u6afb\u4e95 \u6566\u53f8 , Sakurai Atsushi , born March 7, 1966 in Fujioka, Gunma) is a Japanese musician and singer-songwriter.  He has been the vocalist of the rock band Buck-Tick since 1985, previously being their drummer from 1983.  He released the solo album \"Ai no Wakusei\" in 2004 and was also a member of Schwein alongside Hisashi Imai (Buck-Tick), Sascha Konietzko (KMFDM) and Raymond Watts.  In 2015, he formed a solo project called The Mortal. \n\nDr. Frank J. Hayden Secondary School , is located in the northern area of Burlington, Ontario, Canada, at 3040 Tim Dobbie Drive.  It is an English and French immersion school in the Halton District School Board that as of 2015 serves approximately 1400 grade 9-12 students.  In its first year, Dr. Frank J. Hayden Secondary School served approximately 600 students in grades 9\u201310.  The school is named for Special Olympics pioneer Frank Hayden. \n\nThe Closer I Get is the second album by Canadian singer-songwriter Hayden.  It is Hayden's first international release.  In Canada it was released on Hardwood Records/Universal, while in the United States it was released on Outpost Recordings/Geffen/Universal. \n\nMild and Hazy is a 7\" vinyl single by Canadian singer-songwriter Hayden.  It was released in 1996 on Hayden's own label, Hardwood Records as well as on Lunamoth.  The cover is a photograph of Hayden as a toddler.  The song \"Gouge Away\" is a cover of the Pixies, from their album \"Doolittle\". \n\nKyo (\u4eac , Ky\u014d ) is a Japanese musician, poet and singer-songwriter.  He is best known as the vocalist of the metal band Dir en grey.  He has been with the band since its inception in 1997 and was formerly in La:Sadie's.  Kyo was inspired to become a musician when he saw a picture of Buck-Tick vocalist Atsushi Sakurai on the desk of a junior high school classmate.  His vocals span a tenor range. \n\nDewey Beard or Was\u00fa M\u00e1za (\"Iron Hail\", 1858\u20131955) was a Minneconjou Lakota who fought in the Battle of Little Bighorn as a teenager.  After George Armstrong Custer's defeat, Wasu Maza followed Sitting Bull into exile in Canada and then back to South Dakota where he lived on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation.  Chief Iron Hail is often mistaken by historians for Chief Iron Tail, being Lakota contemporaries with similar-sounding names.  Most biographies incorrectly report that Chief Iron Tail fought in the Battle of the Little Bighorn and that his family was killed in 1890 at Wounded Knee, when in truth it was Chief Iron Hail who suffered the loss. \n\nMasami Tsuchiya is a Japanese singer-songwriter and musician, coming to prominence in the late 1970s as the lead vocalist and guitarist in the group Ippu-Do.  His subsequent output includes solo work and collaborations.  Tsuchiya has worked with artists as diverse as English new wave rockers Japan and Bill Nelson, Japanese electronica composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, Duran Duran side-project Arcadia, and Japanese rock band Buck-Tick. \n\nHailstorm Alley is a colloquial term referring to an area of south and central Alberta, Canada where hail storms are frequently produced.  These storms frequently produce hail that is damaging to property.  This area stretches from High River in southern Alberta, northward through Calgary, through Red Deer to Lacombe and then westward to Rocky Mountain House.  It is known to be one of the worst areas in the world for damaging hail produced by thunderstorms.  These are regarded as loose boundaries.  While this area is common for damaging hailstorms, the reality is damaging hailstorms occur over much of central and southern Alberta every summer.  The City of Calgary is regarded as the hailstorm capital of Canada. \n\nThe Alberta Hail Project was a research project sponsored by the Alberta Research Council and Environment Canada to study hailstorm physics and dynamics in order to design and test means for suppressing hail.  It ran from 1956 until 1985.  The main instrument in this research was an S-band circularly polarized weather radar located at the Red Deer Industrial Airport in central Alberta, Canada. \n\n",

        "context": "The Levasseur PL.8 was a single engine, two-seat long-distance record-breaking biplane aircraft modified from an existing Levasseur PL.4 carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft produced in France in the 1920s.  Levasseur built the aircraft in 1927, specifically for pilots Charles Nungesser and Fran\u00e7ois Coli for a transatlantic attempt to win the Orteig Prize.  Only two examples of the type were built, with the first PL.8-01 named \"L'Oiseau Blanc\" (The White Bird), that gained fame as Nungesser and Coli's aircraft. \n\nWilliam Earl Johns (5 February 189321 June 1968) was an English pilot and writer of adventure stories, usually written under the pen name Captain W. E. Johns.  He is best remembered as the creator of the ace pilot and adventurer Biggles. \n\nFran\u00e7ois Coli (June 5, 1881 \u2013 presumably on or after May 8, 1927) was a French pilot and navigator best known as the one-eyed flying partner of Charles Nungesser in their doomed attempt to fly the Atlantic Ocean on the aircraft known as \"L'Oiseau Blanc\". \n\nWooster and Davis-- Lieutenant Stanton Hall Wooster (April 1, 1895 Connecticut - April 26, 1927) and Lieutenant Commander Noel Guy Davis (December 25, 1891 Salt Lake City, Utah - April 26, 1927) were two United States Navy (USN) airmen who made an attempt to fly the Atlantic Ocean from New York-to-Paris in the spring of 1927.  The men were trying to win the $25,000 dollar Orteig Prize offered by New York hotelier Raymond Orteig for the first nonstop flight between New York and Paris.  Competitors for the prize were French World War One ace Rene Fonck and his crew of three, USN Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd, Clarence Chamberlain and a young airmail pilot named Charles Lindbergh.  On the Paris side of the Atlantic their competitors were another World War One French ace, Charles Nungesser, and his navigator Francois Coli. \n\nGervais Raoul Victor Lufbery (March 14, 1885 \u2013 May 19, 1918) was a French and American fighter pilot and flying ace in World War I. Because he served in both the French Air Force, and later the United States Army Air Service in World War I, he is sometimes listed alternately as a French ace or as an American ace.  Officially, all but one of his 17 combat victories came while flying in French units. \n\nL'Oiseau Blanc (commonly known in the English-speaking world as The White Bird ) was a French Levasseur PL.8 biplane that disappeared in 1927, during an attempt to make the first non-stop transatlantic flight between Paris and New York City to compete for the Orteig Prize.  The aircraft was flown by French World War I aviation heroes, Charles Nungesser and Fran\u00e7ois Coli.  The aircraft took off from Paris on 8 May 1927 and was last seen over Ireland.  Less than two weeks later, Charles Lindbergh successfully made the New York\u2013Paris journey and claimed the prize, flying the \"Spirit of St. Louis\". \n\nCharles Eug\u00e8ne Jules Marie Nungesser, MC (15 March 1892 \u2013 presumably on or after 8 May 1927) was a French ace pilot and adventurer, best remembered as a rival of Charles Lindbergh.  Nungesser was a renowned ace in France, ranking third highest in the country with 43 air combat victories during World War I. \n\nSergent Paul Joannes Sauvage was a French World War I flying ace credited with eight confirmed and six unconfirmed aerial victories.  He was originally posted to fly a Nieuport for Escadrille 65, and scored his first victory with them on 16 July 1916.  He became the youngest French ace on 2 October, and held that distinction until his death by anti-aircraft fire on January 7, 1917. \n\nGeorges F\u00e9lix Madon (July 28, 1892 \u2013 November 11, 1924) was the fourth ranked French ace pilot of the First World War.  His lengthy career and wide variety of aviation experiences were remarkable. \n\nL'Oiseau bleu (also known as The Blue Bird and Der Blaue Vogel) is a large oil painting created in 1912\u20131913 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger (1883\u20131956); considered by Guillaume Apollinaire and Andr\u00e9 Salmon as a founder of Cubism, along with Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso.  \"L'Oiseau bleu\", one of Metzinger's most recognizable and frequently referenced works, was first exhibited in Paris at the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants in the spring of 1913 (n. 2087), several months after the publication of the first (and only) Cubist manifesto, \"Du \u00abCubisme\u00bb\", written by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes (1912).  It was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 in Berlin (titled \"Der blaue Vogel\", n. 287).  Apollinaire described \"L'Oiseau bleu\" as a 'very brilliant painting' and 'his most important work to date'.  \"L'Oiseau bleu\", acquired by the City of Paris in 1937, forms part of the permanent collection at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. \n\n",

His first work, ':A Journey to the Spirit Realm\", was published in late autumn 2014.  It was later added to his anthology, \"The Spirit Realm: An Anthology of Fables From The Spirit Realm\".  He has also penned, The Diary Of A Vagabond King, an inspiring true account of his personal experiences over the course of two years, where he was faced with impossible odds, and tragic losses.  The royalties from the sale of the book will be going towards the creation and operation of the Blue Purity Fund created for aiding organizations with programs aimed at getting the nations homeless off the streets and back into being full members of society. \n\nHackers is a 1995 American crime film directed by Iain Softley and starring Jonny Lee Miller, Angelina Jolie, Renoly Santiago, Matthew Lillard, Jesse Bradford, Lorraine Bracco, and Fisher Stevens.  The film follows a group of high school hackers and their involvement in a corporate extortion conspiracy.  Made in the 1990s when the internet was unfamiliar to the general public, it reflects the ideals laid out in the Hacker Manifesto quoted in the film: \"This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch [...] We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.  [...] Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.\"  \"Hackers\" has achieved cult classic status. \n\nRobin Goldstein is an American author, food and wine critic, and economics pundit.  He is known for his books and articles questioning conventional wisdom and pricing in the food and wine industries, particularly a widely publicized expos\u00e9 of Wine Spectator magazine, and for his writing on the Freakonomics blog.  He is author of several books, including \"The Wine Trials\" (the world's bestselling guide to cheap wine), \"The Beer Trials\", and an upcoming book tentatively entitled \"A Defense of Fast Food\".

That same year B-Real of the rap group Cypress Hill saw Psycho Realm performing at Olvera Street for an End Barrio Warfare concert.  Their performance inspired B-Real to the point that he wanted to join the group.  With this time period being the height of Cypress Hill\u2019s career anything Cypress Hill related would get major publicity. \n\nJason Scott \"Jay\" Leiderman (born April 12, 1971) is an American criminal defense lawyer based in Ventura, California. \" The Atlantic\" Magazine called Leiderman the \"Hacktivist\u2019s Advocate\" for his work defending hacker-activists accused of computer crimes, or so-called (\u201cHacktivism\u201d) especially people associated with Anonymous.

The storyline is centered on the Australian teenagers going by the hacker names \"Electron\" and \"Phoenix\", who were members of an elite computer hacking group called 'The Realm' and hacked into some of the most secure computer networks in the world, including those of the US Naval Research Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a government lab charged with the security of the US nuclear stockpile, and NASA.

Smith (February 23, 1936 \u2013 May 14, 2017) was an American investment banker from Chicago.  He had a 40-year career managing corporate acquisitions and venture investments.  He was active in Republican politics.  In 1998 he was identified as a major financial supporter of the 1993 Troopergate story, in which several Arkansas state troopers accused U.S. President Bill Clinton of having carried out sexual dalliances while he was Governor of Arkansas.  In 2017 he confirmed to the \"Wall Street Journal\" that he had tried in 2016 to contact computer hackers, including Russian hackers, in an attempt to obtain opposition research material to use against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.

        "context": "The discography of Screaming Trees, an Ellensburg, Washington-based rock band, consists of seven studio albums, three compilation albums, five extended plays (EP), and six singles, though this does not include any solo material recorded by the individual members of Screaming Trees. \n\nTruly is an American rock band formed in the wake of the grunge era.  It featured singer-guitarist Robert Roth, bassist Hiro Yamamoto, and drummer Mark Pickerel.  Yamamoto and Pickerel were founding members respectively of Soundgarden and Screaming Trees.  While not a commercially successful group like some of their Seattle contemporaries, the band lasted a decade with two studio albums to their name. \n\nScreaming Trees was an American rock band formed in Ellensburg, Washington in 1985 by vocalist Mark Lanegan, guitarist Gary Lee Conner, bass player Van Conner and drummer Mark Pickerel.  Pickerel had been replaced by Barrett Martin by the time the band reached its most successful period.  Although widely associated with grunge, the band's sound incorporated hard rock and psychedelic elements.  During Screaming Trees' existence the band released seven studio albums, five EPs, and three compilations. \n\nChange Has Come was the only recording the Screaming Trees released through Sub Pop.  Released in 1990 the Screaming Trees then moved on to a major label, Epic Records, for their next three albums - \"Uncle Anesthesia\", \"Sweet Oblivion,\" and \"Dust\", as well as the \"Something About Today\" EP. \n\nBeat Happening/Screaming Trees is an EP and a one-off collaboration between Beat Happening (from Olympia, Washington) and Screaming Trees (from Ellensburg, Washington).  Originally released on Homestead Records in 1988, it was later reissued as part of Beat Happening's box set \"Crashing Through\" in 2002.  The journal of Kurt Cobain contains a draft of a letter sent to Mark Lanegan, in which he described \"Polly Pereguin\" as his favorite pop song of the 1980s. \n\nJamboree is the second album by Beat Happening, released in 1988 through K Records/Rough Trade Records.  All songs were produced by Steve Fisk with assistance from Screaming Trees members Mark Lanegan and Gary Lee Conner (who plays a brief guitar solo on \"Midnight a Go-Go\"), except \"Cat Walk,\" produced by Patrick Maley, and \"The This Many Boyfriends Club,\" recorded live by Rich Jensen.  The album marks a darker approach to the Twee pop for which the band is known, due largely to a thicker production than is present on the group's earlier recordings and the dominance of tracks written by Calvin Johnson, while Heather Lewis only provides vocals on two songs, the uncharacteristically brash \"In Between\" and the more typically understated \"Ask Me.\"  At the time of the album's release, Calvin described Jamboree's sound as \"dark and sexy.\"  Still, the band retained their emphasis on exuberance over musicianship, as Bret Lunsford stated in an interview that, while recording album opener \"Bewitched,\" his guitar string got stuck on a protruding screw and he continued to play through the song, hitting the string a bit harder until it became unstuck. \n\nMad Season was an American rock supergroup formed in Seattle, Washington in 1994 by members of three popular Seattle-based bands: Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam and Screaming Trees.  Mad Season released only one album, \"Above\", and is best known for the single \"River of Deceit\".  The band went on a semi-permanent hiatus in 1996 due to the band members' conflicting schedules and vocalist Layne Staley's problems with substance abuse.  Attempts were made in the late 1990s to revive the group without Staley; however, the band dissolved following the death of bassist John Baker Saunders in 1999.  Staley died three years later of a drug overdose. \n\nMark Pickerel is an American musician best known as the original drummer for the Screaming Trees, a rock group from Ellensburg, Washington, that formed in 1985.  Other members of the band included the versatile singer Mark Lanegan and the Conner brothers.  Pickerel played on the band's extended play and first five albums and left the group in 1992 and was replaced by Barrett Martin. \n\nVan Conner (born March 17, 1967 in Apple Valley, California) is an American rock musician.  In 1984 he co-founded the band Screaming Trees with his brother Gary Lee Conner and close friends Mark Lanegan and Mark Pickerel.  On the 25 June 2000 Screaming Trees announced their official breakup.  Conner would start a low key band under the name Gardener which released its only album in the 1990s under the name \"New Dawning Time\".  Conner has also had brief appearances as a session musician with other known bands such as Queens of the Stone Age and helping Mark Lanegan on his solo album I'll Take Care of You. \n\nGary Lee Conner (born Lee Gary Conner on August 22, 1962 in Fort Irwin, California, USA) was the lead guitarist for rock act Screaming Trees, along with his brother Van Conner, who was the band's bassist.  Conner began his career with Screaming Trees in 1985 which lasted until their disbanding in 2000.  During that time he released two non-Tree albums: The Purple Outside-Mystery Lane (1990 New Alliance Records) with brother Patrick Conner on Drums and the single Grasshopper's Daydream/Behind The Smile (1999 sub pop) this album also featured Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age.  Appearances on other artists material include, Beat Happening \"Indian Summer\" and \"Midnight a Go-Go\" from \"Jamboree\" as well as \"Against the 70s\" by Mike Watt from \"Ball-Hog or Tugboat? \" (1995 Columbia Records).  After ten years of seclusion he finally released a new album in 2010 from his band Microdot Gnome.  The album \"4D Sugarcubes\" was released on Moonbus International Recordings in April 2010 as was available on CD and MP3.  At the moment he is planning future releases from Microdot Gnome.  In August 2016, Conner released a long-awaited solo album, Ether Trippers, on Strange Earth Records. \n\n",

After the February Revolution of 1917 he joined the newly formed Russian Provisional Government, first as Minister of Justice, then as Minister of War, and after July 1917 as the government's second Minister-Chairman.  A leader of the moderate-socialist Trudoviks faction of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, he was also vice-chairman of the powerful Petrograd Soviet.  On 7 November, his government was overthrown by the Lenin-led Bolsheviks in the October Revolution.  He spent the remainder of his life in exile, in Paris and New York City, and worked for the Hoover Institution. \n\nTimofey Petrovich Samsonov (Russian: \u0422\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0439 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432 ) (9 May 1888 \u2013 28 October 1955) was a Soviet politician and veteran of the Russian Civil War.  He was a member of the Central Committee elected by the 15th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks),the Central Committee elected by the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Central Committee elected by the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).  He was Chief Administrator (1927\u20131935), head of the Accounting Department (1932\u20131934).  He died in Moscow. \n\nLavr Georgiyevich Kornilov (Russian: \u041b\u0430\u0432\u0440 \u0413\u0435\u043e\u0301\u0440\u0433\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0301\u043b\u043e\u0432 , ] ; 18 August 1870 \u2013 13 April 1918) was a military intelligence officer, explorer, and general in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and the ensuing Russian Civil War.  He is today best remembered for the Kornilov Affair, an unsuccessful endeavor in August/September 1917 that purported to strengthen Alexander Kerensky's Provisional Government, but which led to Kerensky eventually having Kornilov arrested and charged with attempting a coup d'\u00e9tat, and ultimately undermined the rule of Kerensky; strengthening the claims and power of the soviets, and the Bolshevik party. \n\nThe left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks were a series of rebellions and uprisings against the Bolsheviks by rival left-wing parties that started soon after the October Revolution, continued through the Russian Civil War, and lasted into the first few years of Soviet rule.  They were led or supported by left-wing groups such as some factions of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and anarchists.  The uprisings started in 1918 and continued during and after the Civil War until around 1924.  The Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to invite these groups to join the government and instead suppressed them with force. \n\nThe Socialist Revolutionary Party, or Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (the SRs; Russian: \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432-\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0432 (\u041f\u0421\u0420), \u044d\u0441\u0435\u0440\u044b , \"esery\") was a major political party in early 20th century Russia and a key player in the Russian Revolution.  Its general ideology was revolutionary socialism of democratic socialist and agrarian socialist forms.  After the February Revolution of 1917, it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the Russian Provisional Government.  In November 1917, it won a plurality of the national vote in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the Russian Constituent Assembly), but the October Revolution had changed the political landscape and the Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.  The SRs soon split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions.  The anti-Bolshevik faction of this party, known as the Right SRs, which remained loyal to the Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution. \n\nKerensky\u2013Krasnov uprising was an attempt by Alexander Kerensky to regain power after the Bolsheviks overthrew his Provisional Government in Petrograd. \n\nLouise Bryant (December 5, 1885 \u2013 January 6, 1936) was an American feminist, political activist, and journalist best known for her sympathetic coverage of Russia and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution.  Bryant, who married writer John Reed, her second husband, in 1916, wrote about Russian leaders such as Katherine Breshkovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Alexander Kerensky, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky.  Her news stories, distributed by Hearst during and after her trips to Petrograd and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the United States and Canada in the years immediately following World War I.  A collection of articles from her first trip was published in book form as \"Six Red Months in Russia\" in 1918.  During the next year, she defended the revolution in testimony before the Overman Committee, a Senate subcommittee established to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States.  Later in 1919, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks and to denounce armed U.S. intervention in Russia. \n\nCommunism in Russia began after Tsar Nicholas II lost his power during the February Revolution.  The Provisional Government was established under Prince Lvov, however, the Bolsheviks refused to accept the government and revolted in October 1917, taking control of Russia.  Vladmir Lenin, their leader, rose to power and governed between 1917 and 1924.  The Bolsheviks formed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, marking the beginning of the Russian Civil War between the revolutionary Reds and the counter-revolutionary Whites.  In 1922 the Communist Reds were victorious, and formed the Soviet Union.  Lenin died in 1924, starting a power struggle which ended with Joseph Stalin seizing power.  He was the leader of the Communist Party until 1953.  He encouraged political paranoia and conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents of his dominance. \n\nThe Russian Civil War (Russian: \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430\u0301 \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u0438 , \"Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi\" ; November 1917 \u2013 October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.  The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.  Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.  The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.  The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920.  Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.  The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.  There were an estimated 7,000,000\u201312,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.  The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen. \n\nThe Battle of Romanovka was fought in June 1919 during the Russian Civil War.  Russian Bolsheviks of Yakov Triapitsyn launched a surprise attack on an American army camp at Romanovka, Siberia near Vladivostok.  As a result of the engagement, the attacks were repelled.  Romanovka and the Suchan Valley Campaign that followed were the final major engagements of the Russian Civil War involving the United States.  Battles would later break out again between the Americans and Bolsheviks, as well as the Cossacks, on much smaller scales.  Likewise, the Americans were invariably victorious. \n\n",

        "context": "Chiara R. Nappi is an Italian physicist.  Her research areas have included mathematical physics, particle physics, and string theory. \n\nSeven Brief Lessons on Physics (Italian: \"\" ) is a short book by the Italian physicist Carlo Rovelli.  Originally published in Italian in 2014, the book has been translated into 41 languages.  It is an Italian bestseller, with more than 300,000 copies sold in Rovelli's home country. \n\nAldo Pontremoli (] ; 19 January 1896 \u2013 25 May 1928) was an Italian physicist who held a chair of theoretical physics at the University of Milan from 1926 and who founded and directed the Institute of Advanced Physics at the University of Milan from 1924 until his disappearance and presumed death in May 1928.  Pontremoli was one of the six men who disappeared with the airborne envelope of the airship \"Italia\" after it had crashed on the Arctic ice on 25 May 1928. \n\nAntonino Lo Surdo (4 February 1880 in Syracuse \u2013 7 June 1949 in Rome) was an Italian physicist.  He was appointed as professor of physics at the Istituto di Fisica in Rome in 1919; upon the death of Orso Mario Corbino in 1937, he became the director.  Lo Surdo studied terrestrial physics, including seismology and geophysics; the 1908 Messina earthquake caused the death of his parents and other close relatives, except his brother.  He contributed to the foundation of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica under the auspices of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, when its president was Guglielmo Marconi. \n\nGuido Caldarelli (born in Rome on 8 April 1967) is an Italian physicist (statistical physics) and full professor in Theoretical Physics at IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca.  He is married with two children and lives in Lucca. \n\nThe 12-volume Microp\u00e6dia is one of the three parts of the 15th edition of \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", the other two being the one-volume \"Prop\u00e6dia\" and the 17-volume \"Macrop\u00e6dia\".  The name \"Microp\u00e6dia\" is a neologism coined by Mortimer J. Adler from the ancient Greek words for \"small\" and \"instruction\"; the best English translation is perhaps \"brief lessons\". \n\nClaudio Pellegrini (born in Rome on May 9, 1935) is an Italian physicist known for his pioneering work on X-ray free electron lasers and collective effects in relativistic particle beams.  He was educated at the Sapienza University of Rome where he received the Laurea in Fisica \"summa cum laude\" in 1958 and the Libera Docenza, in 1965.  From 1958 to 1978, he worked at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati for high energy and nuclear physics.  In the early 1960s, he was at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics (NORDITA) in Copenhagen, working on an alternative formulation of the theory of general relativity using tetrad fields to obtain, among other things, a better description of the energy-momentum complex.  (See \"Teleparallelism\" for a summary of the theoretical context of this work.)  In 1978, he moved to the United States and began work at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where he was an Associate Chairman of the National Synchrotron Light Source and co-director at the Center for Accelerator Physics.  In 1989, he accepted an appointment at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) as a professor of physics, and later became a Distinguished Professor. \n\nEnrico Fermi ( ; ] ; 29 September 1901\u00a0\u2013 28 November 1954) was an Italian physicist and the creator of the world's first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1.  He has been called the \"architect of the nuclear age\" and the \"architect of the atomic bomb\".  He was one of the very few physicists in history to excel both theoretically and experimentally.  Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and the discovery of transuranic elements.  He made significant contributions to the development of quantum theory, nuclear and particle physics, and statistical mechanics. \n\nSergio Ferrara (born May 2, 1945) is an Italian physicist working on theoretical physics of elementary particles and mathematical physics.  He is renowned for the discovery of theories introducing supersymmetry as a symmetry of elementary particles (super-Yang\u2013Mills theories, together with Bruno Zumino) and of supergravity, the first significant extension of Einstein's general relativity, based on the principle of \"local supersymmetry\" (together with Daniel Z.

Directed, produced and edited by Katherine Foronjy and Joseph Coburn, the film follows a wide variety of fans over the course of the 2005 and 2006 baseball seasons, culminating in an exciting 7 game series against the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS.  \"Mathematically Alive\" shows the emotional attachment that fans develop for their team and how it can be the source of great joy or tremendous sadness.  In addition to the hundreds of fans interviewed for the film, Coburn and Foronjy also caught up with former Mets players Bud Harrelson, Ron Swoboda, Ed Charles, Tim Teuffel and legendary broadcaster Ralph Kiner.  The filmmakers also interviewed Dr. Daniel Wann, a sports psychology professor at Murray State University, who explains many of the psychological characteristics sports fans share.  Of particular focus in the film are a group of female Mets fans whose favorite player is former catcher Mike Piazza.  They wait for his arrival outside the Shea stadium parking lot on game days, and travelled around the country to see him play even when he was no longer a player on the Mets. \n\nE.

        "context": "The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland.  The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie.  It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes.  Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters. \n\nThe collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds.  The type originated in Scotland and Northern England.  The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout.  Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders.  Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct.  Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types.  Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability.  While the AKC has a breed they call \"Collie\", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds.  There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports.  They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity. \n\nThe viol , viola da gamba ] , or (informally) gamba, is any one of a family of bowed, fretted and stringed instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes where the tension on the strings can be increased or decreased to adjust the pitch of each of the strings.  Frets on the viol are usually made of gut, tied on the fingerboard around the instrument's neck, to enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly.  Frets improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone which better matches the open strings.  Viols first appeared in Spain in the mid to late 15th century and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque (1600-1750) periods.  Early ancestors include the Arabic \"rebab\" and the medieval European vielle, but later, more direct possible ancestors include the Venetian \"viole\" and the 15th- and 16th-century Spanish \"vihuela\", a 6-course plucked instrument tuned like a lute (and also like a present-day viol) that looked like but was quite distinct from (at that time) the 4-course guitar (an earlier chordophone). \n\nThe Toy Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog, categorized as a terrier.  The breed was bred down in size in North America from the Manchester Terrier, and is placed in the Toy Group by the American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club (the Manchester Terrier is placed in the Terrier Group.)  Neither the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale nor The Kennel Club recognize a Toy variety of the Manchester Terrier. \n\nThe Irish Red and White Setter () is a breed of dog, more specifically a setter.  As with all the setters and the Pointer, it is classified as a gundog in the UK and is included in the sporting group in America and Canada.  It is virtually identical in use and temperament to the related Irish Setter and its other setter cousins, the Gordon and English setters, but is more often found as a working gun dog. \n\nThe English Setter is a medium size breed of dog.  It is part of the Setter family, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters.  The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail.  The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton. \n\nThe Russian Toy (also known as the Russian Toy Terrier, and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy, Toychik,Russian: \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0442\u043e\u0439, \u0422\u043e\u0439\u0447\u0438\u043a ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier which is known today as the Manchester Terrier.  There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat.  The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier.  Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the \"Terrier\" was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010.  The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia. \n\nThe Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier.  Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times. \n\nA Feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants.  These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct English White Terrier.  These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners.  Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier. \n\nFlorence Nagle (26 October 1894\u00a0\u2013 30 October 1988) was a trainer and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of pedigree dogs, and an active feminist.  Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, and went on to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions.  Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle.  She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions.  The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters. \n\n",

        "context": "Ethiopia is a landlocked sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa.  Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east.  Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa's second-most populous nation.  Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity's oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution.  Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world.  Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC.  The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name \"Ethiopia\" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots).  After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint (\"Era of the Judges/Princes\"), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history.  Ethiopia's borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization.  It was brutally occupied by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, ending with its liberation by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces. \n\nP'ent'ay (from Amharic: , also transliterated as Pentay or Pente) is an Amharic and Tigrinya language term for a Christian of a Protestant denomination, widely used in Ethiopia and among Ethiopians and Eritreans living abroad.  The term was coined in the late 1960s and was used as a pejorative for churches that believed in the Pentecostal experience.  Today, it is used to describe local Protestant Christians who are not members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo churches.  The term \"P'ent'ay\" is a shortening of the word \"Pentecostal\"; however, it is widely used when referring to all Protestant Christians whether they are actual Pentecostals or not.  Some Orthodox will also apply the term to the small Catholic population of Ethiopia.  The equivalent rendition in many other languages is Evangelicals.  The four major Evangelical denominations in Ethiopia are: the Kale Heywet (Word of Life); Mekane Yesus (Place of Jesus), Lutheran; Mulu Wongel (Full Gospel) and Meserete Kristos (meaning \"Christ foundation\") or Mennonite.  Some P'ent'ay communities - especially Mekane Yesus - have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which represents mainstream, traditional Ethiopian Christianity.  But for the most part they are very Pentecostal in their worship and theology. \n\nHerbert S. Lewis (born May 8, 1934) is Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he taught from 1963 to 1998.  He has conducted extensive field research.  In Ethiopia, Lewis studied both the history of the Oromo (Galla) Kingdom of Jimma Abba Jifar and the lives of contemporary Oromos from 1958\u201360 and in 1965\u201366.  (Many of his ethnographic photographs are visible in the University of Wisconsin's Digital Library.  See the link to Africa Focus below).  His work in Ethiopia was concerned above all with political leadership and community organization as well as ethnohistory and culture history.  The book, originally titled A Galla Monarchy: Jimma Abba Jifar, Ethiopia, 1830-1932, is a study of the nature of the monarchy, the sources of the ruler's power, as well as its origins.  The study in 1965-66 centered on community life and the leadership of spirit mediums, k'allu, who effectively organized religious life and conflict resolution, and provided a degree of political leadership for rural districts. \n\nThe Second Battle of Agordat was fought in late December 1893, between Italian colonial troops and Mahdists from the Sudan.  Emir Ahmed Ali campaigned against the Italian forces in eastern Sudan and led about 10\u201312,000 men east from Kassala.  This force encountered 2,400 Italians and their Eritrean askaris at Agordat, west of Asmara, commanded by Colonel Arimondi.  Over 1,000 Dervishes, including the Emir, were killed in severe fighting.  The outcome of the battle constituted: \n\nThe Treaty of Addis Ababa, signed 23 October 1896, formally ended the First Italo\u2013Ethiopian War on terms mostly favorable to Ethiopia.  This treaty superseded a secret agreement between Ethiopia and Italy negotiated days after the decisive Battle of Adwa in March of the same year, in which Ethiopian forces commanded by Menelik II defeated the Italians.  The most important concession the Italians made was the abrogation of the Treaty of Wuchale and recognizing Ethiopia as an independent country. \n\nEthiopia\u2013Japan relations are the international relations between Ethiopia and Japan.  Both were nations with an ancient history which successfully repulsed European military advances to dominate them, Ethiopia at the Battle of Adwa, and Japan at the Battle of Tsushima, and as a result both nations considered each other potential allies prior to World War II. \n\nThe First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896.  It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate.  Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria.  Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected.  In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war.  Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the United Kingdom and France in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.  Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.  Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea. \n\nThe Battle of Adwa (Amharic: \u12a0\u12f5\u12cb; Amharic translated: Adowa, or sometimes by the Italian name \"Adua\") was fought on 2 March 1896/Yekatit 23, 1889 according to Ethiopian calendar between the Ethiopian Empire and the Kingdom of Italy near the town of Adwa, Ethiopia, in Tigray.  This climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty. \n\nGiuseppe Edoardo Arimondi, OSML, OMS, OCI (Savigliano, 26 April 1846 \u2013 Adwa, 1 March 1896) was an Italian general, mostly known for his role during the First Italo-Ethiopian War.  He was one of the few European commanders who gained a victory over the Mahdists before Kitchener's Expedition, soundly defeating them at Agordat in 1893.  After a long and successfull colonial service, he died in combat at Adwa, and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor. \n\nSaint Ephigenia of Ethiopia or Iphigenia of Ethiopia (Spanish: \"Efig\u00eania\" ; Portuguese: \"Ifig\u00eania\" ; French: \"Iphig\u00e9nie\" ; ), also called Iphigenia of Abyssinia (1st century), is a folk saint whose life is told in the \"Golden Legend\" as a virgin converted to Christianity and then consecrated to God by St. Matthew the Apostle, who was spreading the Gospel to the region of \"Ethiopia\", which in this case is understood to be located in the regions south of the Caspian Sea, either in one of the provinces of Mesopotamia (Assyria and Babylon), or in Ancient Armenia (Colchis). \n\n",

Unlike the vice president, the president pro tempore is an elected member of the Senate, able to speak or vote on any issue.  Selected by the Senate at large, the president pro tempore has enjoyed many privileges and some limited powers.  During the vice president's absence, the president pro tempore is empowered to preside over Senate sessions.  In practice, neither the vice president nor the president pro tempore usually presides; instead, the duty of presiding officer is rotated among junior senators of the majority party to give them experience in parliamentary procedure. \n\nRobert E.

During his private sector employment, Mr. Nyce was active in his community of East Allen Township.  From 1979 to 1984 he served as a member and Chairman of the East Allen Township Municipal Authority and again from 2007 to 2013 as a member and Treasurer.  From 2011 to 2013 Mr. Nyce negotiated and helped close the sale of the East Allen Township Municipal Authority's assets to The City of Bethlehem and the Bath Borough Municipal Authority thereby ensuring high quality service of water and sewer for the future for all residents of East Allen Township.

Following the campaign, he was hired as the Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Independent Regulatory Review Commission (IRRC).  Mr. Nyce served for eight years in that capacity overseeing two major revisions to the Regulatory Review Act and many significant regulatory issues facing the residents of Pennsylvania.  The PA IRRC reviews all regulations promulgated in PA and provides citizens an opportunity to comment on and affect those regulations prior to their promulgation by the state agency that authored the regulation.  The two exceptions are the PA Fish and Boat Commission and the PA Game Commission which remain outside the regulatory review process.

Kennedy's Funeral. \n\nExecutive Order 10925, signed by President John F. Kennedy on March 6, 1961, required government contractors to \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\"  It established the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity (PCEEO), which was chaired by then Vice President Lyndon Johnson.  Vice Chair and Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg was in charge of the Committee's operations.  This first implementation of Affirmative Action was meant to give equal opportunities in the workforce to all U.S. citizens, not to give special treatment to those discriminated against. \n\nThe Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, or U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on Economic and Technological Cooperation, was a United States and Russian Joint Commission developed to increase cooperation between the two countries in several different areas.  The Commission was developed by the United States\u2019 President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin at a summit in Vancouver in April 1993.  Al Gore, the United States Vice President, and Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian Prime Minister, were appointed as co-chairmen, and the committee derives its name from those two individuals.  Before his appointment to the Commission, Chernomyrdin oversaw the Soviet national oil industry as minister from 1985-1989.  After the fall of the Soviet Union, Chernomyrdin organized the Soviet oil industry into the Gazprom corporation. \n\nAlfred Balk (July 24, 1930 \u2013 November 25, 2010) was an American reporter, nonfiction author and magazine editor who wrote groundbreaking articles about housing segregation, the Nation of Islam, the environment and Illinois politics.

Prior to this he served eight months as the 40th Vice President of the United States, following the resignation of Spiro Agnew.  He was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment, and consequently the only person to have served as both Vice President and President of the United States without being elected to executive office.

        "context": "The Scottish Borders (Scots: \"The Mairches\" , \"The Marches\") is one of 32 council areas of Scotland.  It borders the City of Edinburgh, Dumfries and Galloway, East Lothian, Midlothian, South Lanarkshire, West Lothian and, to the south and east, Northumberland in England.  The administrative centre of the area is Newtown St Boswells. \n\nThe Royal Burgh of Haddington (Scots: \"Haidintoun\" ) is a town in East Lothian, Scotland.  It is the main administrative, cultural and geographical centre for East Lothian, which as a result of late-nineteenth century Scottish local government reforms, actually took the form of the county of Haddingtonshire for the period from 1889-1921.  It lies about 20 mi east of Edinburgh.  The name Haddington is Anglo-Saxon, dating from the sixth or seventh century AD when the area was incorporated into the kingdom of Bernicia.  The town, like the rest of the Lothian region, was ceded by King Edgar of England and became part of Scotland in the tenth century.  Haddington received burghal status, one of the earliest to do so, during the reign of David I (1124\u20131153), giving it trading rights which encouraged its growth into a market town. \n\nDirleton Kirk is situated to the north of the village green in Dirleton, in East Lothian, Scotland.  Dirleton village lies on the south shore of the Firth of Forth 21 miles east of Edinburgh and two miles west of North Berwick on the A198 road.  The church is at grid reference [ NT512842] . \n\nLothian and Borders is an area in south-east Scotland consisting of the East Lothian, City of Edinburgh, Midlothian, West Lothian areas (collectively known as Lothian) along with the Scottish Borders. \n\nDirleton (Scottish Gaelic 'Duighreach') is a village and parish in East Lothian, Scotland approximately 20 mi east of Edinburgh on the A198.  It contains 7500 acre .  Dirleton lies between North Berwick (east), Gullane (west), Fenton Barns (south) and the Yellowcraigs nature reserve, Archerfield Estate and the Firth of Forth (north).  Gullane parish was joined to Dirleton parish in 1612 by an Act of Parliament because \"Golyn (as it was anciently spelt) is ane decaying toun, and Dirleton is ane thriven place.\" \n\nYellowcraig, less commonly known as Broad Sands Bay, is a coastal area of forest, beach and grassland in East Lothian, south-east Scotland.  Yellowcraig is partly within the Firth of Forth Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).  It is bordered to the north by the Firth of Forth, to the south by the village of Dirleton and Dirleton Castle, to the east by the North Berwick West Links golf course, and to the west by the Archerfield Estate and Links golf courses. \n\nLord Haliburton of Dirleton (or \"Dirletoun\") was a Scottish Lordship of Parliament created \"circa.\"  1450 for Sir Walter de Haliburton, Lord High Treasurer of Scotland.  The seat of Lord Haliburton was at Dirleton Castle in present-day East Lothian. \n\nJohn David Home Robertson (born 5 December 1948) is a Labour politician in Scotland.  He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Berwick and East Lothian and East Lothian from 1978 to 2001 and a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for East Lothian from 1999 until 2007. \n\nDirleton Castle is a medieval fortress in the village of Dirleton, East Lothian, Scotland.  It lies around 2 mi west of North Berwick, and around 19 mi east of Edinburgh.  The oldest parts of the castle date to the 13th century, and it was abandoned by the end of the 17th century. \n\nSt. Mary's Priory, North Berwick, was a monastery of nuns in medieval East Lothian, Scotland.  Founded by Donnchad I, Earl of Fife (owner of much of northern East Lothian) around 1150, the priory lasted for more than four centuries, declining and disappearing after the Scottish Reformation.  It had been endowed by the Earls of Carrick as well as the Earls of Fife, but over time lost its dependence on these and came to be controlled by the more locally based Home (or Hume) family, who eventually acquired the priory's lands as a free barony. \n\n",

        "context": "Radiohead Box Set is a box set of the first six studio albums and one live album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 10 December 2007.  The box set is available as a seven CD box set, a digital download and a 4GB USB Stick.  The box set peaked at #95 in Canada's album charts. \n\nStart Together is compilation box set containing the entire remastered discography of the American rock band Sleater-Kinney.  A digital version of the remastered box set was released on September 2, 2014.  3,000 limited edition physical copies of the box set were released on colored vinyl with a 44-page companion book on October 21, 2014.  The box set also included a 7\" single of the song \"Bury Our Friends\" from their 2015 album \"No Cities to Love\". \n\nNashville Rebel is a box set by Waylon Jennings, released on RCA Records through Legacy Recordings in 2006.  According to Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, it is \"\"the first comprehensive, multi-label Waylon Jennings retrospective ever assembled\", comprising ninety-two songs recorded between 1958 and 1994, with selections from the majority of the singer's recording career.  The first track of the box set is the Buddy Holly-produced \"Jole Blon,\" released in 1958, while the last is \"I Do Believe,\" a song produced by Don Was that was included on The Highwaymen's 1995 release, \"The Road Goes on Forever\".  The other material on the box set covers Jennings' career chronologically, with songs ranging from his years on RCA's roster to later compositions from his short-lived stay at Epic Records; it ignores, however, the tracks from Jennings albums released on independent labels.  The majority of the singer's charting singles are included in the package, as are collaborations such as \"Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\" with Willie Nelson and \"Highwayman\" with The Highwaymen.  A notable addition is the previously unreleased \"The Greatest Cowboy of Them All,\" a 1978 duet with Johnny Cash which was later recorded by Cash alone for \"A Believer Sings the Truth\" (1979) and \"The Mystery of Life\" (1991); two others, \"It's Sure Been Fun\" and \"People in Dallas Got Hair,\" had never been released in the United States.  \"Nashville Rebel\" was released on four CDs, with a 140-page booklet and liner notes by Rich Keinzle and Lenny Kaye. \n\nLed Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 is a double album released by Atlantic Records on 21 September 1993.  This box set features the rest of the English rock band Led Zeppelin's catalogue not included in the 1990 4-CD box set \"Led Zeppelin\", all digitally remastered, including the previously unreleased studio track \"Baby Come On Home\".  A 54-page booklet was also included with the release.  Between this box set and the 4-CD box set every track from the band's nine studio albums are featured along with two BBC live recordings; the band's only non-LP b-side; and one studio outtake. \n\nThe Doors: Vinyl Box Set is the seventh box set for the rock band The Doors.  It is a 7 record set of the original 6 Doors albums, remastered in stereo from the original analogue tapes with a mono version of the debut album.  Artwork, packaging, and inner sleeves are replicas of the originals from 1967-1971.  The box set was originally planned to be released in October 2007, but was delayed due to a problem with the vinyl, as well as other problems in the production of the box set.  The delay ran until February 2008.  Reasons for the delay included faulty test pressings, inferiority of the L.A. Woman artwork, and bad compounds in the vinyl that was used first, which caused a search for a new source of virgin vinyl. \n\nLive in Japan is a four-disc box set by American saxophonist John Coltrane and his last group, featuring the quintet of Coltrane, his wife/pianist Alice, saxophonist/bass clarinetist Pharoah Sanders, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Rashied Ali.  The 4-CD set compiles all the music issued as three albums in the seventies by Impulse! ; \"Concert In Japan\" (1973, US 2-LP, electronically processed for compatible quadrophonic/stereo), \"Coltrane In Japan\" (1974, Japan 3-LP (side six is blank), mono) and \"Second Night In Tokyo\" (1976, Japan 3-LP (side six contains an interview, mono).  (Some of this material was also reissued as two 2-LP sets in 1980 by MCA under the titles \"Coltrane In Tokyo Vol.  1\" and \"Coltrane In Tokyo Vol.  2\") The first CD issues were by Impulse!  Japan as two 2-CD sets: \"Live In Japan Vol.  1\" (same as \"Coltrane In Japan\") and \"Live In Japan Vol.  2\" (same as \"Second Night In Tokyo\").  The US 4-CD edition includes both of these volumes, with identical mastering from the original mono tapes.  The side six interview from \"Second Night In Tokyo\" has never been reissued on any CD edition. \n\nChrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003.  At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format.  This box set, and the companion release \"Rancho Texicano\", were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from \"ZZ Top's First Album\", \"Rio Grande Mud\", and \"Tejas\", aside from 1977's \"The Best of ZZ Top\" which features two tracks from \"Rio Grande Mud\" and one track from \"First Album\". \" Tres Hombres\" and \"Fandango! \" were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes. \n\nBack to Mono (1958\u20131969) is a box set (4 compact discs or 5 vinyl LPs) compilation of the recorded work of record producer Phil Spector, through the 1960s, released in 1991 by ABKCO as #7118-2.  The first track, \"To Know Him Is to Love Him,\" released in 1958, features Spector performing as part of the group the Teddy Bears.  Initially a vinyl album-sized package, the box contained a booklet with photographs, complete song lyrics, discographical information, and a reproduction of the essay on Spector by Tom Wolfe, \"The First Tycoon of Teen.\"  The package also contained a small, round, red \"Back to Mono\" pin. \n\nTrash Box is a 5-CD box set of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings, primarily by American bands.  This box set is similar to the earlier \"Pebbles Box\" (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc.  Supposedly, \"the Trash Box\" collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records).  However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on \"Pebbles, Volume 4\" have been eschewed entirely.  Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the \"Pebbles Box\".  Although most of the recordings on \"the Trash Box\" were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series.  Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit \"I Fought the Law (but the Law Won)\" by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) \u2013 which is also included in the \"Pebbles Box\" \u2013 in place of the much rarer \"Wine Wine Wine\" by Bobby Fuller that appears on \"Pebbles, Volume 2\". \n\nMono Masters is a compilation album by the Beatles, and is an alternate, all-mono version of the album \"Past Masters\".  \"Mono Masters\" was originally a two-CD set included as part of \"The Beatles in Mono\" box set.  The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix (the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo, and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version).  As a result, the track listing for \"Mono Masters\" differs from \"Past Masters\" on the second half of disc two, omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix (\"Old Brown Shoe\", \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" and \"Let It Be\"), and adding several songs released on stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes.  Tracks 9\u201312 and 15 were prepared in March 1969 for release as a 7\" mono \"Yellow Submarine\" EP, two months after the release of the similarly titled soundtrack album, but the project was scrapped, although the EP was mastered.  Subsequently, the tracks were only released in stereo (and in an electronically produced mono mixdown, or \"fold-down\", of the stereo mix), while the true mono mixes remained unreleased.  \"Get Back\" (with B-side \"Don't Let Me Down\") was the final Beatles single mixed for mono format.  It was released in the UK in mono, though the US release was in stereo.  Thus, the songs that were originally released on stereo singles in the UK are omitted on this release. \n\n",

At the time of the October Revolution he was a member of the Military Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet; on meeting him in November, Leon Trotsky was so impressed with his \"great creative \"\u00e9lan\" combined with concentrated attention to detail\" that he appointed him his deputy on the Revolutionary Military Council, where he served with distinction during the Russian Civil War (1918-1920) and helped improve the fighting condition of the Red Army\u2014Trotsky called him the Carnot of the Russian Revolution.  In 1924 his position as Trotsky's deputy was taken over by Grigory Zinoviev's ally Mikhail Frunze.  Instead, he was made chairman of the Mossukno state textile trust, and the following May he left on a tour of Germany, France, and the United States to acquire technical information.  On August 27, 1925 he died in a boating accident on Long Lake (New York) along with , the first head of Amtorg Trading Corporation.

In 1985 Waksberg became National Vice-President of BACSJ's umbrella organization, the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews.  Waksberg frequently visited Jewish communities the Soviet Union and the Former Soviet states and coordinated briefings of the American travelers interested in visiting those communities.  In 1990 Waksberg took on the role of Director of the Center for Jewish Renewal, newly established by UCSJ.  The mission of the CJR was to promote the renewal and development of Jewish life in the USSR and the emigration rights, human rights and resettlement needs of Jews in the Former Soviet Union.  The CJR established a network of human rights and emigration bureaus in major cities of the former Soviet Union.  In mid-1990s Waksberg was a member of Bay Area Council's Board of Directors and served as Director of Development and Communication of the UCSJ.

In 1906, Kirilenko was born at Alexeyevka in Belgorod Oblast to a Ukrainian working-class family.  He graduated in the 1920s from a local vocational school, and again in the mid-to-late 1930s from the Rybinsk Aviation Technology Institute.  He became a member of the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) in 1930.  As many like him, Kirilenko climbed up the Soviet hierarchy through the \"industrial ladder\"; by the 1960s, he was Vice-Chairman of the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR).  After Nikita Khrushchev's forced resignation, Kirilenko became Leonid Brezhnev's \"chief lieutenant\" within the Central Committee. \n\nAnastas Ivanovich Mikoyan ; 25 November 1895 \u2013 21 October 1978) was an Old Bolshevik and Soviet statesman during the mandates of Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev, and Brezhnev.  He was the only Soviet politician who managed to remain at the highest levels of power within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as that power oscillated between the Central Committee and the Politburo, from the latter days of Lenin's rule, throughout the eras of Stalin and Khrushchev, until his peaceful retirement after the first months of Brezhnev's rule. \n\nMS \"Excelsior Neptune\" (originally, the \"Feliks Dzerzhinskiy\") was an ocean liner owned by the Soviet Union's Black Sea Shipping Company.  She was built in 1958 by VEB Mathias-Thesen Werft, Wismar, East Germany, as one of the Mikhail Kalinin series of ships.

        "context": "Silene menziesii is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names Menzies' campion and Menzies' catchfly.  It is native to western North America from Alaska through the western half of Canada to the southwestern United States.  It can be found in many types of habitat and it is quite common in much of its range.  It is variable in morphology and there are a number of varied subtaxa.  In general, it is a perennial herb growing from a caudex, appearing matlike, decumbent, or erect, with stems a few centimeters to over half a meter long.  It is usually hairy in texture, with upper parts bearing sticky glandular hairs.  The leaves are lance-shaped, oppositely arranged in pairs, and a few centimeters in length, upper leaves usually smaller than lower.  Flowers may occur in a cyme at the top of the stem, or in leaf axils, or both.  Each is encapsulated in a hairy, veined calyx of fused sepals.  The petals are white with two lobes at the tips.  The plant is dioecious with male and female plants producing different flowers.  The male and female flower types look the same externally; the stamens are reduced in female plants and the stigmas are reduced in the male. \n\nSilene stenophylla is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae.  Commonly called narrow-leafed campion, it is a species in the genus \"Silene\".  It grows in the Arctic tundra of far eastern Siberia and the mountains of Northern Japan.  Frozen samples, estimated via radiocarbon dating to be around 32,000 years old, were discovered in the same area as current living specimens, and in 2012 a team of scientists successfully regenerated a plant from the samples. \n\nSilene tomentosa, the Gibraltar campion, is a very rare flowering plant of the genus \"Silene\" and the family Caryophyllaceae.  It is a woody-based perennial about 40cm high, with bilobed flowers ranging from pink to pale violet and is endemic to Gibraltar. \n\nSilene oregana is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names Oregon silene, Oregon campion and Oregon catchfly.  It is native to the western United States, including the Great Basin, where it grows in habitat such as sagebrush and forests.  It is a perennial herb growing from a woody caudex and taproot, sending up an erect, mostly unbranched stem which may be 70 centimeters tall.  The lance-shaped leaves are up to 8 centimeters long around the caudex, and shorter farther up the stem.  Flowers occur in a terminal cyme and sometimes in leaf axils.  Each flower is encapsulated in a hairy, glandular calyx of fused sepals.  The five petals are creamy white or pink-tinged in color and each has four to six long, fringelike lobes at the tip. \n\nSilene noctiflora is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names night-flowering catchfly, nightflowering silene and clammy cockle.  It is native to Eurasia, but it is known on other continents as an introduced species and sometimes a weed.  In North America, it is a common weed of grain crops in the Canadian prairie provinces and in much of the United States.  It grows in fields and in other disturbed habitat. \n\n\"Silene\" are a flowering plant that evolved a dioecious reproductive system.  This is made possible through heteromorphic sex chromosomes expressed as XY.  \"Silene\" recently evolved sex chromosomes 5-10 million years ago and are widely used by geneticists and biologists to study the mechanisms of sex determination since they are one of only 39 species across 14 families of angiosperm that possess sex-determining genes.  \"Silene\" are studied because of their ability to produce offspring with a plethora of reproductive systems.  The common inference drawn from such studies is that the sex of the offspring is determined by the Y chromosome. \n\nSilene conoidea is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names weed silene and large sand catchfly.  It is native to Eurasia, and it is known in other parts of the world, such as western North America, as a weed.  It is an annual herb growing up to a meter in height with a hairy, partially glandular stem.  The lance-shaped leaves are up to 12 centimeters long near the base of the plant and smaller farther up.  The flower is enclosed in an inflated, hairy, glandular calyx of fused sepals which is ridged with many veins.  It is open at the top, revealing five bright pink petals. \n\nSilene antirrhina is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names sleepy silene and sleepy catchfly.  It is native to the Americas, where it is widespread throughout North America and parts of South America.  It is known in Europe as an introduced species. \n\nSilene suksdorfii is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names Suksdorf's silene, Suksdorf's catchfly and Cascade alpine campion.  It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, where it occurs from Washington and Idaho to northern California.  It is mainly an alpine species, growing in the talus of high mountain slopes.  It can also be found below the tree line in forested subalpine habitat.  It is a squat perennial herb producing several erect stems from a leafy, woody caudex.  It generally takes a clumpy form.  The stems grow up to 10 or 15 centimeters tall and are hairy in texture, with glandular, sticky areas on the upper parts.  The leaves occur in tufts around the caudex.  They are fleshy and coated in soft hairs.  Solitary flowers arise on erect peduncles.  Each is encapsulated in an inflated calyx of fused sepals, which is starkly purple-veined and has purplish glandular hairs.  The petals are white or purple-tinged and have two lobes at their tips and appendages at their bases. \n\nSilene latifolia (formerly \"Melandrium album\"), the white campion is a dioecious flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae, native to most of Europe, Western Asia and Northern Africa.  It is a herbaceous annual, occasionally biennial or a short-lived perennial plant, growing to between 40-80 centimetres tall.  It is also known in the USA as bladder campion but should not be confused with \"Silene vulgaris\", which is more generally called Bladder Campion. \n\n",

        "context": "The Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 \"Sparviero\" (Italian for sparrowhawk) was a three-engined Italian medium bomber with a wood-and-metal structure.  Originally designed as a fast passenger aircraft, between 1937 and 1939 this low-wing monoplane set 26 world records, qualifying it for some time as the fastest medium bomber in the world.  It first saw action during the Spanish Civil War and flew on all fronts in which Italy was involved during World War II.  It achieved success as a torpedo bomber in the Mediterranean theater, and became the best-known Italian aeroplane of the war.  It was easily recognizable due to its distinctive fuselage dorsal \"hump\", and was well liked by its crews, who nicknamed it \"il gobbo maledetto\" (\"damned hunchback\"). \n\nThe Tupolev Tu-12 (development designation Tu-77) was an experimental Soviet jet-powered medium bomber developed from the successful piston-engined Tupolev Tu-2 bomber after the end of World War II.  It was designed as a transitional aircraft to familiarize Tupolev and the VVS with the issues involved with jet-engined bombers. \n\nSouth West Pacific Area (SWPA) was the name given to the Allied supreme military command in the South West Pacific Theatre of World War II.  It was one of four major Allied commands in the Pacific War.  SWPA included the Philippines, Borneo, the Dutch East Indies (excluding Sumatra), East Timor, Australia, the Territories of Papua and New Guinea, and the western part of the Solomon Islands.  It primarily consisted of United States and Australian forces, although Dutch, Filipino, British and other Allied forces also served in the SWPA. \n\nThe Asiatic-Pacific Theater, was the theater of operations of U.S. forces during World War II in the Pacific War during 1941-45.  From mid-1942 until the end of the war in 1945, there were two U.S. operational commands in the Pacific.  The Pacific Ocean Areas (POA), divided into the Central Pacific Area, the North Pacific Area and the South Pacific Area, were commanded by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief Pacific Ocean Areas.  The South West Pacific Area (SWPA) was commanded by General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Allied Commander South West Pacific Area.  During 1945, the United States added the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, commanded by General Carl A. Spaatz. \n\nThe Coastwatchers, also known as the Coast Watch Organisation, Combined Field Intelligence Service or Section C, Allied Intelligence Bureau, were Allied military intelligence operatives stationed on remote Pacific islands during World War II to observe enemy movements and rescue stranded Allied personnel.  They played a significant role in the Pacific Ocean theatre and South West Pacific theatre, particularly as an early warning network during the Guadalcanal campaign. \n\nEdwin A. Doss (September 14, 1914January 7, 1996) was an American fighter pilot and commander in the U.S. Air Force during World War II and Korean War.  Logging more than 4,500 flying hours, Doss flew 573 combat hours and accrued 280 combat missions during his leadership in the South West Pacific Theatre and Korean War.  For his two-year service as commander of the 35th Fighter Group during World War II, Doss was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, Legion of Merit, and the Air Medal.  He received his second Legion of Merit and the Korean Ulchi medal with a Silver Star for his assignments as commander of the 49th Fighter Bomber Wing and the 3rd Bomber Wing at Kunsan, Korea.  Colonel Doss\u2019s service has been cited as integral to the development of long-range fighter tactics in the South West Pacific Theater. \n\nNo. 12 Squadron was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) general purpose, bomber and transport squadron.  The squadron was formed in 1939 and saw combat in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II.  From 1941 to 1943, it mainly conducted maritime patrols off northern Australia.  The squadron was based at Merauke in western New Guinea from November 1943 to July 1944, when it was withdrawn from operations.  After being re-equipped, it operated as a heavy bomber unit from February 1945 until the end of the war.  The squadron continued in this role until it was redesignated No. 1 Squadron RAAF in February 1948.  The squadron was reformed in 1973 to operate transport helicopters but was again disbanded in 1989. \n\nThe South West Pacific theatre, during World War II, was a major theatre of the war between the Allies and Japan.  It included the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies (except for Sumatra), Borneo, Australia and its mandate Territory of New Guinea (including the Bismarck Archipelago) and the western part of the Solomon Islands.  This area was defined by the Allied powers' South West Pacific Area (SWPA) command. \n\nThe English Electric Canberra is a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber that was manufactured during the 1950s.  It was developed by English Electric during the mid-to-late 1940s in response to a 1944 Air Ministry requirement for a successor to the wartime de Havilland Mosquito fast-bomber.  Amongst the performance requirements for the type was the demand for an outstanding high altitude bombing capability in addition to flying at high speeds.  These were partly accomplished by making use of newly developed jet propulsion technology.  When the Canberra was introduced to service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), the type's first operator, in May 1951, it became the service's first jet-powered bomber aircraft. \n\nNo. 2 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) squadron that operates from RAAF Base Williamtown, near Newcastle, New South Wales.  From its formation in 1916 as part of the Australian Flying Corps, it has flown a variety of aircraft types including fighters, bombers, and Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C).  During World War I, the squadron operated on the Western Front conducting fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions.  It was disbanded in mid-1919, following the end of hostilities.  The squadron was briefly re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF, but was disbanded after only a couple of months and not reformed until 1937.  It saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and, equipped with English Electric Canberra jets, in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War.  The squadron was again disbanded in 1982, following the retirement of the Canberra.  It was re-formed in 2000 to operate the Boeing 737 AEW&C \"Wedgetail\".  One of the six Boeing 737s was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014, as part of Australia's contribution to the military coalition against ISIS. \n\n",

        "context": "John A. Brown was an Oklahoman department store chain.  It operated under that name from 1932, when its founder bought out its predecessor and renamed the chain for himself.  After Mr. Brown died in 1940, his widow took over management until her own death in 1967, forcing a change in ownership.  Dayton-Hudson, another retail company, but continued operating the chain under its own name, until 1984, when Dayton-Hudson sold the Brown chain to Dillard's, another national chain, which combined all of the Brown stores under its own name.  The flagship store on West Main Street was closed in 1974 and was subsequently razed as part of an urban renewal project.  The project was supposed to result in a new shopping center known as the Galleria.  However, the project was never completed, so the Brown chain never returned to downtown. \n\nSavaCentre was a chain of 13 hypermarkets and later a further seven discount supermarkets owned and operated jointly by Sainsbury's and BHS, beginning in 1977.  Sainsbury's later took full control of the stores alone in 1989, rebranding them as Sainsbury\u2019s SavaCentre, until 2005 when the stores were integrated into the Sainsbury's supermarket brand.  The hypermarket stores ranged in size from 66,000 sqft to 117,000 sqft and the discount supermarkets ranged in size from 31,000 sqft to 70,000 sqft .  At the time of its inception, it was the only dedicated hypermarket chain in the UK. \n\nUno-X is a chain of unmanned fuel stations throughout Norway and Denmark.

In 1995 it was bought by Host Marriott Corporation and operated as a Courtyard by Marriott hotel until 2003.  Holiday Inn bought the resort in December 2003.  The hotel closed on August 14, 2004 after Hurricane Charley caused extensive damage when it blew through Florida.  It was owned by CIG LBV LLC and stayed under the Holiday Inn brand, part of the InterContinental Hotels Group PLC, when it reopened on February 12, 2010 after a reportedly $35 million renovation.  On December 9, 2016, the hotel was sold and from then on operated and managed by Interstate Hotels & Resorts, still operating under the Holiday Inn brand.  The resort has 323 rooms, a heated swimming pool and a hot tub.  The hotel also has a view of the Disney Springs area and the rest of the Walt Disney World Resort from certain areas of the hotel. \n\nTesco Extra is a chain of mainly out-of-town hypermarkets, owned and operated by the United Kingdom's largest retailer, Tesco. \n\nTazweed Center is a chain of independently owned and operated hypermarkets operating in the Syrian refugee camps.

Since 18 December 2008 Selver also operated in Latvia, but in the end of 2009 due to the financial crisis Selver was forced to close all its 6 supermarkets in Latvia.  There are currently 44 stores in operation all over Estonia (as of December 2014). \n\nCarrefour S.A. (] ) is a French multinational retailer headquartered in Boulogne Billancourt, France, in the Hauts-de-Seine Department near Paris.  It is one of the largest hypermarket chains in the world (with 1,462 hypermarkets at the end of 2016).  Carrefour operates in more than 30 countries, in Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa.  Carrefour means \"crossroads\" and \"public square\" in French.

The parent companies of Lewis's have gone into administration many times over the years, including 1991.  The first store, which opened in Liverpool city centre, became the flagship of the chain of stores operating under the Lewis's name.  Several stores in the chain were bought in 1991 by the company Owen Owen and continued to operate under the Lewis's brand name for several years, but after the closure of the Manchester store in 2002, only the original Liverpool store continued to trade under the Lewis's name.

A 100 mi race was held in May at the track in 1952, however the event did not become a regular one on the NASCAR schedule until 1957, as a 300 mi race in the Convertible Division, known as the Rebel 300.  In 1966, the race was expanded to 400 mi , and in 1973 to 500 mi .  In 1994, the race was returned to 400 miles.  In 2005, as part of the settlement of the Ferko lawsuit and as part of a schedule realignment, Darlington was forced to contract to one race date, with the 500 mile race (the famous Southern 500) moving to Mother's Day weekend.  The 400 mile race was eliminated, although Dodge's sponsorship was transferred to the 500 miler. \n\nJohn Sherman \"Johnny\" Rutherford III (born March 12, 1938), also known as \"Lone Star JR\", is an American former automobile racing driver.

The facility holds weekly stock car races and demolition derbies during the summer months.  The track was built in 1857 for horse racing at the Orange County Fair and staged its first automobile race on August 16, 1919.  The fair began as an agricultural exhibit in 1843 and was permanently located in the Wallkill\u2013Middletown area in 1857.  The speedway is located at 239 Wisner Avenue in Middletown on land which was known as The Ogden Tract in the mid-1850s.  It was originally a half-mile horse racing track known as the Harry Clay Oval, named after a race horse that was famous at that time.  Over the years, the track was widened and lengthened to a true 5/8-mile race track. \n\nThe Lean Horse Ultramarathon is run in August every year in the Black Hills of South Dakota.  It was first run in 2005.  It features a 100-mile race, a 50-mile race, and a 50-kilometer race.  Most of the course is on the George S. Mickelson Trail.

From 1966 to 1995, a 500-mile (805-km) race was held; the race was known as the Peach Blossom 500 (1966), the Carolina 500 (1967\u20131985), and the Goodwrench 500 (1986\u20131995).  In 1996, the race was shortened to its current distance of 400 miles; the 400 mile race was called the Goodwrench Service 400 (1996\u20131997), the GM Goodwrench Service Plus 400 (1998), the Dura Lube/Big K 400 (1999), the Dura Lube/Kmart 400 (2000), the Dura Lube 400 (2001), and the Subway 400 (2002\u20132004). \n\nThe Louis Schwitzer Award is presented annually to an engineer, or a team of engineers, for excellence in the design, development and implementation of new, innovative motorsports technology concepts for use in the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race.

It first opened in 1966 as 1/4\u00a0mile (0.4\u00a0km) and 5/8\u00a0mile (1.6\u00a0km) dirt oval (Trico Speedway), which operated until 1967 and 1973, respectively.  The facility was reopened and paved in 1983.  With a slogan of \"the fastest 3/8-mile race track in America,\" the oval features 19\u00a0degree banking through the turns and 16\u00a0degrees on the straightaways creating three distinct grooves making for very fast turns.  The aluminum grandstands stretch from Turn 4 all the way down the front straightaway to Turn 1.  The speedway closed in 2003, but reopened on March 11, 2006 as an American Speed Association member track. \n\nAllison began in 1909 when James A. Allison, along with three business partners, helped found and build the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.  In 1911, Allison\u2019s new track held the first Indianapolis 500 mile race.  In addition to funding several race teams, Jim Allison established his own racing team in 1915 and quickly gained a reputation for his work on race cars and automotive technology in general. \n\nBel Air Racetrack was a horse racing facility located one mile north of Baltimore Pike and east of Tollgate Road in Bel Air, Maryland.  The 100-acre site was originally plotted in 1870 but was later improved and expanded in 1936 by new owner Ray Bryson to include a 3/4 mile race track, new starting gate, and larger grandstands.  The track flourished until the 1940s when the owners became embroiled in political efforts to close the track.  After Bryson died in 1958, the state legislature eventually prevailed and the track closed in 1960.  The property is now the site of Harford Mall. \n\n",

        "context": "Jacopo (Giacomo) Puccini (] ; 26 January 1712 16 May 1781) was an 18th-century Italian composer who lived and worked primarily in Lucca, Tuscany.  He was the first of five generations of composers, the most famous of whom was his great-great-grandson, the opera composer Giacomo Puccini. \n\nLa boh\u00e8me (also known as \"La boh\u00e8me de Puccini\") is a 1988 Italian-French film of an opera directed by Luigi Comencini.  It is based on Giacomo Puccini's \"La boh\u00e8me\". \n\nCesira Ferrani (May 8, 1863 in Turin \u2013 May 4, 1943 in Pollone) was an Italian operatic soprano who is best known for debuting two of the most iconic roles in opera history, Mim\u00ec in the original 1896 production of Giacomo Puccini's \"La boh\u00e8me\" and the title role in Puccini's \"Manon Lescaut\" in its 1893 world premiere.  Ferrani sang a wide repertoire that encompassed not only verismo opera but the works of composers like Verdi, Gounod, Wagner, and Debussy. \n\nLa boh\u00e8me (also known as \"La boh\u00e8me de Puccini\") is a 2008 Austrian-German film of an opera directed by Robert Dornhelm.  It is based on Giacomo Puccini's \"La boh\u00e8me\". \n\nRon Bottcher (11 May 1940 \u2013 12 April 1991) was an American operatic baritone who was actively performing with both the New York City Opera (NYCO) and the Metropolitan Opera during the 1960s.  A native of Sandpoint, Idaho, he earned music degrees from the University of Montana and the Curtis Institute of Music.  He made his debut at the Santa Fe Opera in the summer of 1961, where he portrayed the roles of Leopold in Richard Strauss' \"Der Rosenkavalier\", Marcello in Giacomo Puccini's \"La boh\u00e8me\", and the Head waiter in Paul Hindemith's \"Neues vom Tage\".  His roles at the NYCO included Escamillo in Georges Bizet's \"Carmen\" and Sharpless in Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\" among others.  At the Met he created roles in the world premieres of Samuel Barber's \"Antony and Cleopatra\" and Marvin David Levy's \"Mourning Becomes Electra\".  He died at the age of 50 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan of AIDS related illness. \n\nGianni Schicchi (] ) is a comic opera in one act by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Giovacchino Forzano, composed in 1917\u201318.  The libretto is based on an incident mentioned in Dante's \"Divine Comedy\".  The work is the third and final part of Puccini's \"Il trittico\" (The Triptych)\u2014three one-act operas with contrasting themes, originally written to be presented together.  Although it continues to be performed with one or both of the other \"trittico\" operas, \"Gianni Schicchi\" is now more frequently staged either alone or with short operas by other composers.  The aria \"O mio babbino caro\" is one of Puccini's best known, and one of the most popular arias in opera. \n\nLa fanciulla del West (\"The Girl of the West\") is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by and , based on the play \"The Girl of the Golden West\" by the American author David Belasco.  \"Fanciulla\" followed \"Madama Butterfly\", which was also based on a Belasco play.  The opera has fewer of the show-stopping highlights that are characteristic of other Puccini works, but is admired for its impressive orchestration and for a score that is more melodically integrated than is typical of his previous work.  \"Fanciulla\" displays influences from composers Claude Debussy and Richard Strauss, without being in any way imitative.  Similarities between the libretto and the work of Richard Wagner have also been found, though some attribute this more to the original plot of the play, and have asserted that the opera remains quintessentially Italian. \n\nThe Festival Puccini (Puccini Festival) is an annual summer opera festival held in July and August to present the operas of the famous Italian composer Giacomo Puccini. \n\nLilian Sukis (born 29 June 1939, Kaunas) is a Canadian operatic soprano of Lithuanian birth.  After earning diplomas from the University of Toronto and McMaster University, she made her professional opera debut in 1964 as Kate Pinkerton in Giacomo Puccini's \"Madama Butterfly\" with the Canadian Opera Company.  In 1965 she sang the role of Countess Almaviva in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\" at the Stratford Festival.  That same year she became a pupil at the Metropolitan Opera Studio and School.  She made her debut at the Met in 1967 as Helen Niles in the world premiere of Marvin David Levy's \"Mourning Becomes Electra\".  In 1969 she became a member of the Bavarian State Opera where she remained for more than 20 years.  She has also appeared as a guest artist with several major opera houses and opera festivals internationally, including the Bayreuth Festival, the Frankfurt Opera, Graz, the Hamburg State Opera, the Salzburg Festival, and the Vienna State Opera among others. \n\n\"O mio babbino caro \" (\"Oh My Beloved Father\") is a soprano aria from the opera \"Gianni Schicchi\" (1918) by Giacomo Puccini to a libretto by Giovacchino Forzano.  It is sung by Lauretta after tensions between her father Schicchi and the family of Rinuccio, the boy she loves, have reached a breaking point that threatens to separate her from Rinuccio.  It provides an interlude expressing lyrical simplicity and single-hearted love in contrast with the atmosphere of hypocrisy, jealousy, double-dealing, and feuding in the medieval Florence of Puccini's only comedy.  It provides the only set-piece in the through-composed opera. \n\n",

        "context": "\"On My Mind\" is a song by English singer Ellie Goulding from her third studio album \"Delirium\" (2015).  It was released as the album's lead single on 17 September 2015.  It was written by Goulding, Max Martin, Savan Kotecha and Ilya Salmanzadeh.  \"On My Mind\" is an electropop and R&B song whose instrumentation consists of scratchy guitars, trap drums, slapped beats and sharp, syncopated electronica.  Lyrically, \"On My Mind\" talks about a one-night stand with someone the protagonist shouldn't be with, having a dichotomy between heart and head.  Though firmly denied by Goulding, many critics considered it an answer song to Ed Sheeran's \"Don't\". \n\nEnglish singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding has recorded songs for three studio albums and guest features.  After signing a contract with record label Polydor Records in July 2009, Goulding began to work on her debut studio album, \"Lights\", which was ultimately released in February 2010.  The first single released from the album was \"Under the Sheets\", which Goulding wrote in collaboration with Starsmith.  Starsmith co-wrote four other songs and served as the album's primary producer.  Goulding also collaborated with Jonny Lattimer on the singles \"Starry Eyed\" and \"The Writer\", and shared writing credits with Fraser T Smith on \"Your Biggest Mistake\".  In November 2010, the singer re-released \"Lights\" as \"Bright Lights\", which included the standard version of the album and several new songs.  She collaborated with Richard Stannard and Ash Howes on \"Lights\" and recorded a cover version of Elton John's \"Your Song\".  At this time, Goulding also contributed guest vocals on the song \"Wonderman\" for Tinie Tempah's debut studio album \"Disc-Overy\" (2010). \n\n\"Something in the Way You Move\" is a song by English singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding from her third studio album, \"Delirium\" (2015).  The song was serviced to contemporary hit radio in the United States on 19 January 2016 as the album's second single in North America, and third overall.  It reached number 51 on the UK Singles Chart and number 43 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \n\n\"Love Me like You Do\" is a song recorded by English singer Ellie Goulding for the \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" (2015).  The song was written by Savan Kotecha, Ilya Salmanzadeh, Tove Lo, Max Martin and Ali Payami; the latter two also produced it.  Goulding was selected to sing the track.  It was released on 7 January 2015 as the second single from the soundtrack.  The song was also included on Goulding's third studio album, \"Delirium\" (2015). \n\n\"Army\" is a song by English singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding from her third studio album, \"Delirium\" (2015).  The song was released on 9 January 2016 as the album's second single. \n\nHalcyon is the second studio album by English singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding, released on 5 October 2012 by Polydor Records.  It was recorded between 2011 and 2012, during promotion of her debut album, \"Lights\" (2010).  Goulding worked with several producers on the album, including Jim Eliot, Starsmith, Billboard, Justin Parker, MONSTA, Madeon and Mike Spencer, in addition to collaborating with artists such as Tinie Tempah and Calvin Harris. \n\n\"Flashlight\" is a song by English singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding featuring production work from DJ Fresh, released as the fourth single from Fresh's forthcoming fourth studio album.  It was released on 28 September 2014 in the United Kingdom as a single, although it was previously out on Goulding's album from 2013.  The song features English singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding and also included as one of the tracks on Goulding's \"Halcyon Days\" (2013), the reissue of her second studio album, \"Halcyon\" (2012).  The Invisible Men assisted the artists in writing the song. \n\nDelirium is the third studio album by English singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding, released on 6 November 2015 by Polydor Records.  Music critics were generally impressed by the overall production of the record, although they were ambivalent in regards to its originality.  It debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart and the US \"Billboard\" 200, earning Goulding her highest-charting record in the latter country and her highest first-week sales figures in both territories.  The album spawned three singles: \"On My Mind\", \"Army\" and \"Something in the Way You Move\". \n\n\"Outside\" is a song by Scottish DJ and record producer Calvin Harris from his fourth studio album, \"Motion\" (2014).  The song features English singer Ellie Goulding and was released on 20 October 2014 as the fourth single from the album.  It marks the second collaboration between Harris and Goulding, following the single \"I Need Your Love\" (2013).  \"Outside\" is also included on the deluxe edition of Goulding's third studio album, \"Delirium\". \n\nThe Delirium World Tour is the third headlining concert tour by British singer and songwriter Ellie Goulding to promote her third studio album, \"Delirium\" (2015).

It has 475 students enrolled from Pre-kindergarten through grade 9; the boarding program (grades 7\u20139) enrolls 120 students from throughout the United States and more than 19 foreign countries.  Fay opened its Primary School (Pre-K to Grade Two) in 2010 and moved its 6th grade into the Lower School program (now 3rd to 6th) in the 2012\u201313 school year. \n\nPrinceton High School was founded in 1867 and graduated its first class in 1869.  The school was started as a boarding school and taught subjects as English, mathematics, history, and the sciences.  The school was enlarged in both 1894 and 1908 in order to accommodate for increases in attendance.  The school was completely destroyed by fire on December 15, 1924.  Plans were then drawn up to build a new school, but in the mean time classes were held in City Hall, the Post Office, and the Christian and Mission Covenant Churches in Princeton.  The new school opened its doors on September 27, 1926.  The building, 350 ft long and 100 ft wide, contained twenty classrooms; an auditorium seating 1,100; a library; a science lecture room; chemistry, physics and botanical laboratories; and a gymnasium.  The building is still in use today, though several additions and remodelings have taken place since then. \n\nCotter High School is the sole Roman Catholic High School in Winona, Minnesota, and is one of the first in the state.

The policy includes a significant expansion of the Australian immigration detention facility on Manus Island, where refugees will be sent to be processed prior to resettlement in Papua New Guinea, and if their refugee status is found to be non-genuine, they will be either repatriated, sent to a third country other than Australia or remain in detention indefinitely.  The policy was announced on 19 July 2013 by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Papua New Guinean Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, effective immediately, in response to a growing number of asylum seeker boat arrivals.  The then Opposition Leader Tony Abbott initially welcomed the policy, while Greens leader Christine Milne and several human rights advocate groups opposed it, with demonstrations protesting the policy held in every major Australian city after the announcement. \n\n",

The show premiered on YouTube on December 12, 2014.  The series was written and created by CJ Daugherty and Jack Jewers. \n\nRaaz Pichhle Janm Ka (Hindi: \u0930\u093e\u091c\u093c \u092a\u093f\u091b\u0932\u0947 \u091c\u0928\u092e \u0915\u093e , \"Past Life Secrets\") is an Indian reality television series based on the technique of past life regression.  The NDTV Imagine show is hosted by actor Ravi Kishan, while the past life regression sessions are conducted by Mumbai-based psychologist Trupti Jayin.  The first season started on December 7, 2009, was planned for a 20-episode run from Monday to Friday, 9.30 pm, by Ideas Box Entertainment, got an extension of 20 episodes, and ended on January 15, 2010, while Second season started on October 23, 2010, with actor, Chunky Pandey as guest. \n\nThe reset button technique (based on the idea of \"status quo ante\") is a plot device that interrupts continuity in works of fiction.  Simply put, use of a reset button device returns all characters and situations to the \"status quo\" they held before a major change of some sort was introduced.  Typically it occurs either in the middle of a program and negates a portion of it, or it occurs at the beginning, or very end, of a program to negate all that came before it.  Often used in science fiction television series, animated series, soap operas, and comic books, the device allows elaborate and dramatic changes to characters and the fictional universe that might otherwise invalidate the premise of the show with respect to future episodes or issues continuity.  Writers may, for example, use the technique to allow the audience to experience the death of the lead character, which traditionally would not be possible without effectively ending the work. \n\nRising Star is a French musical television competition series based on the Rising Star contest series based on the Israeli programme \"HaKokhav HaBa\".  The TV viewers become the instant ultimate juries with expert panelists given only a nominal percentage weight in voting.  The French rights were bought by specialized music-oriented station M6. \n\nIron Man, also known as Iron Man: The Animated Series, is an American animated television series based on Marvel Comics' superhero Iron Man.  The series aired from 1994 to 1996 in syndication as part of \"The Marvel Action Hour\", which packaged \"Iron Man\" with another animated series based on Marvel properties, the \"Fantastic Four\", with one half-hour episode from each series airing back-to-back.  The show was backed by a toy line that featured many armor variants. \n\nRaimund Harmstorf (7 October 1939 in Hamburg \u2013 3 May 1998 in Marktoberdorf) was a German actor.  He became famous as the protagonist of a German TV mini series based on Jack London's the Sea-Wolf (which was sold into many countries) and starred later on successfully in another German TV series based on Jules Verne's Michael Strogoff. \n\nRipley's Believe It or Not!  is the name of several documentary television series based on the newspaper feature.  The first series aired on NBC from 1949 to 1950, and was hosted by Robert L. Ripley until his death, after which several substitute hosts filled in.  The series was revived for ABC in the 1980s, and was hosted primarily by Jack Palance.  Another revival debuted on TBS in 2000, and aired until 2003, with Dean Cain as host.  A Filipino version, hosted by Chris Tiu, debuted in 2008.  An animated series based on the \"Ripley's\" franchise was also created. \n\n\"The Office\" is a television series based on the British television comedy of the same name.  The format of the series is a parody of the fly on the wall documentary technique that intersperses traditional situation comedy segments with mock interviews with the show's characters, provides the audience access to the ongoing interior monologues for all of the main characters, as well as occasional insights into other characters within the show. \n\nAuger electron spectroscopy (AES; pronounced ] in French) is a common analytical technique used specifically in the study of surfaces and, more generally, in the area of materials science.  Underlying the spectroscopic technique is the Auger effect, as it has come to be called, which is based on the analysis of energetic electrons emitted from an excited atom after a series of internal relaxation events.  The Auger effect was discovered independently by both Lise Meitner and Pierre Auger in the 1920s.  Though the discovery was made by Meitner and initially reported in the journal \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik\" in 1922, Auger is credited with the discovery in most of the scientific community.  Until the early 1950s Auger transitions were considered nuisance effects by spectroscopists, not containing much relevant material information, but studied so as to explain anomalies in X-ray spectroscopy data.  Since 1953 however, AES has become a practical and straightforward characterization technique for probing chemical and compositional surface environments and has found applications in metallurgy, gas-phase chemistry, and throughout the microelectronics industry. \n\nKatri, Girl of the Meadows (\u7267\u5834\u306e\u5c11\u5973\u30ab\u30c8\u30ea , Makiba no Sh\u014djo Katori ) is an anime series based on the Finnish novel, \"\"Paimen, piika ja em\u00e4nt\u00e4\"\" by Auni Nuolivaara.  The series was broadcast originally in Japan in 1984 as part of the children's anthology series \"World Masterpiece Theater\", also known simply as \"\"Meisaku\" from Nippon Animation.  The anthology had before and after produced a great variety of animated series based on different children's novels from around the world; among them were \"\" (1983) and \"Little Princess Sara\" (1985).  In Europe, where \"World Masterpiece Theater\" series have found huge success, \"Katri, Girl of the Meadows\" made its way to different countries, including Spain, Italy, France, and Germany.  The series has never been broadcast or published in Finland where it remains mostly unknown. \n\n",

He played collegiately at West Virginia and professionally in the American Football League, where he played for the AFL Champion Oakland Raiders in the second AFL-NFL World Championship Game, held after the 1967 season.  He attended Munhall High School in Pittsburgh.  His six-year pro career was spent with the Oakland Raiders, who he helped win the AFL title, the Cincinnati Bengals, and the Boston Patriots.  After his playing career ended, Herock was a player personnel executive in the NFL with the Raiders, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Atlanta Falcons.  He is known for trading Brett Favre from the Falcons to the Green Bay Packers at the urging of head coach Jerry Glanville. \n\nThe 1989 season was the Houston Oilers 30th season and their 20th in the National Football League (NFL).  The franchise scored 365 points while the defense gave up 412 points.  Their record of 9 wins and 7 losses resulted in a second-place finish in the AFC Central Division.  The Oilers appeared once on Monday Night Football and appeared in the playoffs for the third consecutive year.  It would be Jerry Glanville\u2019s final year as the Oilers coach.  Perhaps one of the lowest points of the season for the Oilers was their second to last game against division rival Bengals.  The Bengals thumped the Oilers 61-7 in that game.  This loss marked the worst defeat for the team during its tenure in Houston.  As of 2017, the worst defeat for the team known either as the Oilers or the Titans was in 2009 when they lost 59-0 to the New England Patriots.  It was the second time the Oilers had allowed 61 points to the Bengals, the other being a 61-17 loss at home in 1972.  \n\nThe 1990 Atlanta Falcons season was the franchise's 25th season in the National Football League (NFL).  Jerry Glanville was hired to be the team's new coach.  The franchise changed their helmets from red to black.  Atlanta looked to improve on its 3-13 record from 1989.  The team did improve on its 3-13 record, finishing 5-11, but the Falcons missed the playoffs for the eighth straight season.  The season started out pretty well for Atlanta, as they beat playoff contenders Houston, New Orleans, and Cincinnati at home.  The team sat at 3-4 after their win against Cincinnati.  It then lost seven games in a row before winning its last two to end the season.  Atlanta went 5-3 at home, but winless on the road, which cost them a trip to the postseason. \n\nThe 2013 East\u2013West Shrine Game was the 88th staging of the all-star college football exhibition game featuring NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision players and a few select invitees from Canadian university football.  The game featured over 100 players from the 2012 college football season, and prospects for the 2013 Draft of the professional National Football League (NFL).  In the week prior to the game, scouts from all 32 NFL teams attended.  The proceeds from the East-West Shrine Game benefit Shriners Hospitals for Children.  Jerry Glanville and Leeman Bennett were named coaches on December 5, 2012.  The West defeated the East 28-13. \n\nWilliam Keith Bostic (born January 17, 1961) is a former professional American football player who played for seven seasons in the National Football League (NFL).  During his career he played safety for the Houston Oilers and the Cleveland Browns.  Bostic served as the Oiler defensive captain under Jerry Glanville.  He earned one Pro Bowl selection and missed another based on a tiebreaker for the last safety chosen.  In his Pro Bowl season, he led the American Football Conference in interceptions. \n\nDarrel \"Mouse\" Davis (born September 6, 1932) is a retired American football coach and former player.  A veteran coach at the high school, college, and professional levels, he last coached with Jerry Glanville at Portland State and with June Jones at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  Davis served as the head football coach at Portland State University from 1975 to 1980, compiling a record of 42\u201324.  He has also been a head coach with the Denver Gold of the United States Football League (1985), the New York/New Jersey Knights of the World League of American Football (1991\u20131992), and the Detroit Fury (2001\u20132002) and the San Diego Riptide (2003) of the Arena Football League.  A native of Washington, Davis grew up in Oregon, where he started his coaching career as a high school football coach.  Davis is now widely regarded as the 'godfather' of the run and shoot offense. \n\nKeith Bostic is an American Software Engineer and one of the key people in the history of Berkeley Software Distribution UNIX and Open Source software. \n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers are a professional American Football team playing in the National Football League.  Their 1987 season saw the team record an 8-7 record and fail to reach the playoffs.  Noll was renowned as a stoic character, but in complete contrast was his reaction to Jerry Glanville, the head coach of the Oilers.  After the Steelers second meeting, Noll in the post game handshake grabbed Glanville and told him he'd better watch out or he'd get jumped on.  This was in reaction to Glanville's earlier comments on how the Oilers field was the 'house of pain' and his prediction that his players would intentionally hurt the Steelers. \n\nLucky to Be Alive is the seventh studio album by the American country music band Confederate Railroad.  The project marks the first album release in nine years for the Grammy-nominated group, and was released on July 15 to music retailers nationwide.

The city's sex ratio of 1025 is among the best for any city in India which has a population of one million or more. \n\nIn 2001, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, conducted a national census in Bangladesh, ten years after the 1991 census.  They recorded data from all of the districts and upazilas and main cities in Bangladesh including statistical data on population size, households, sex and age distribution, marital status, economically active population, literacy and educational attainment, religion, number of children etc.  According to the adjusted 2001 census figures, Bangladesh's population stood at 129.3 million (an initial count put it at 124.4 million; an adjustment for the standard rate of undercounting then boosted the figure).  According to the census, Hindus were 9.2 per cent of the population. \n\nUrbanization in India began to accelerate after independence, due to the country's adoption of a mixed economy, which gave rise to the development of the private sector.  Urbanisation is taking place at a faster rate in India.  Population residing in urban areas in India, according to 1901 census, was 11.4%.  This count increased to 28.53% according to 2001 census, and crossing 30% as per 2011 census, standing at 31.16%.  According to a survey by UN State of the World Population report in 2007, by 2030, 40.76% of country's population is expected to reside in urban areas.  As per World Bank, India, along with China, Indonesia, Nigeria, and the United States, will lead the world's urban population surge by 2050. \n\nHockley is a large village and civil parish in Essex, England located between Chelmsford and Southend-on-Sea.  More specifically it lies between Rayleigh and Rochford.  It came to prominence during the coming of the railway in the 1890s and at the 2001 census had a population of 13,616 people, reducing to 9,616 at the 2011 Census, many of whom commute to London.

Development of the subdivision (initially called \"Fairhaven II\" after the neighbouring community to the east, began in the early 1980s.  The extreme west end of the neighbourhood remained undeveloped until the subsequent creation of the adjacent Blairmore Suburban Centre led to the final phase of Parkridge being built out in the early 2010s.  Whereas the majority of residents are employed in the sales and service sector, the next highest employer is business, finance and administration.  The two main age groups are those in their 40s and teenagers as of 2005.  Until recently Parkridge was the farthest western neighbourhood of Saskatoon south of 22nd Street.  However, new construction will soon see Neighbourhood 2 of the Blairmore SDA bear that claim to fame.  In comparison, the neighbourhood of Parkridge with a 2001 census population of 4,505 is larger than the Saskatchewan city of Melville which had a population of 4,149 in 2006, and 4,453 in 2001 and Parkridge is a little smaller than the provincial city of Humboldt which was 4,998 in 2006, and 5,161 in 2001.

        "context": "Cypress-pine is the common name used for three closely related genera of conifers in the cypress family Cupressaceae: \n\nFokienia is a genus of conifer tree belonging to the cypress family.  In its characteristics, \"Fokienia\" is intermediate between the genera of \"Chamaecyparis\" and \"Calocedrus\".  Genetically \"Fokienia\" is much closer to \"Chamaecyparis\", and not all researchers recognize \"Fokienia\" as a separate genus.  The genus comprises only one living species, Fokienia hodginsii or Fujian cypress (; Vietnamese: \"P\u01a1mu\" ), and one fossil species (\"Fokienia ravenscragensis\"). \n\nCupressaceae is a conifer family, the cypress family, with worldwide distribution.  The family includes 27\u201330 genera (17 monotypic), which include the junipers and redwoods, with about 130\u2013140 species in total.  They are monoecious, subdioecious or (rarely) dioecious trees and shrubs 1 \u2013 tall.  The bark of mature trees is commonly orange- to red- brown and of stringy texture, often flaking or peeling in vertical strips, but smooth, scaly or hard and square-cracked in some species. \n\nThe genus Cupressus is one of several genera within the family Cupressaceae that have the common name cypress; for the others, see cypress.  It is considered a polyphyletic group.  Based on genetic and morphological analysis, the \"Cupressus\" genus is found in the Cupressoideae subfamily.  The common name comes from Old French \"cipres\" and that from Latin \"cyparissus\", which is the latinisation of the Greek \u03ba\u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 (\"kyp\u00e1rissos\"). \n\nPilgerodendron is a genus of conifer belonging to the cypress family Cupressaceae.  It has only one species, Pilgerodendron uviferum, and is endemic to the Valdivian temperate rain forests and Magellanic subpolar forests of southern Chile and southwestern Argentina.  It grows from 40 to 55\u00b0S in Tierra del Fuego, where it is the southernmost conifer in the world.  It is a member of subfamily Callitroideae, a group of distinct southern hemisphere genera associated with the Antarctic flora. \n\nThe Frenchman Formation is stratigraphic unit of Late Cretaceous (late Maastrichtian) age in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.  It is present in southern Saskatchewan and the Cypress Hills of southeastern Alberta.  The formation was defined by G.M. Furnival in 1942 from observations of outcrops along the Frenchman River, between Ravenscrag and Highway 37.  It contains the youngest of dinosaur genera, much like the Hell Creek Formation in the United States. \n\nLibocedrus is a genus of five species of coniferous trees in the cypress family Cupressaceae, native to New Zealand and New Caledonia.  The genus is closely related to the South American genera \"Pilgerodendron\" and \"Austrocedrus\", and the New Guinean genus \"Papuacedrus\", both of which are included within \"Libocedrus\" by some botanists.  These genera are rather similar to the Northern Hemisphere genera \"Calocedrus\" and \"Thuja\": in earlier days, what is now \"Calocedrus\" was sometimes included in \"Libocedrus\".  They are much less closely related, as recently confirmed (Gadek et al. 2000).  The generic name means \"teardrop cedar\", apparently referring to drops of resin. \n\nAjugeae is a tribe of the Teucrioideae subfamily of the family Lamiaceae and might contain the genera \"Acrymia\" , \"Ajuga\" , \"Cymaria\" , \"Garrettia\" , \"Holocheila\" . \n\nCedrol is a sesquiterpene alcohol found in the essential oil of conifers (cedar oil), especially in the genera \"Cupressus\" (cypress) and \"Juniperus\" (juniper).  It has also been identified in \"Origanum onites\", a plant related to oregano.  Its main uses are in the chemistry of aroma compounds.  It makes up about 19% of cedarwood oil Texas and 15.8% of cedarwood oil Virginia. \n\n",

        "context": "The 2003 WNBA Season was the Women's National Basketball Association's seventh season.  It was first season in which teams either folded or relocated, as well as the first to have teams that were not co-owned with NBA teams.  The Orlando Miracle relocated to Connecticut and became the Connecticut Sun, the Utah Starzz relocated to San Antonio, Texas and became the San Antonio Silver Stars.  Meanwhile, both the Miami Sol and the Portland Fire folded, while the Charlotte Sting became the second WNBA team without a brother NBA team.  The schedule increased from 32 games per team to 34, where it stands to this day.  The season ended with the Detroit Shock winning their first WNBA Championship. \n\nThe Charlotte Hornets are a professional basketball club based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  They are members of the National Basketball Association (NBA), playing in the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference.  The original Charlotte Hornets franchise played in Charlotte from 1988\u20132002 before relocating to New Orleans, Louisiana and becoming the New Orleans Hornets.  A new franchise, the \"Charlotte Bobcats\", began play in the 2004\u201305 season.  The team played for ten seasons as the Bobcats before adopting the Hornets name for the 2014\u201315 season.  The Hornets name was left available after the New Orleans Hornets became the New Orleans Pelicans.  As part of a deal between the Bobcats, Hornets and NBA, the renamed Hornets reclaimed the original Hornets' history and records from 1988 to 2002, while all of the Hornets' records from 2002 to 2013 remained with the Pelicans.  As a result, the Hornets are now reckoned as having suspended operations after the 2001\u201302 season before returning as the Bobcats in 2004; This has allowed all of Charlotte's NBA history to be recognized under one single franchise. \n\nThe Charlotte Hornets are an American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  They play in the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The Hornets were first established in 1988 as an expansion team, but relocated to New Orleans following the 2001\u201302 season.  In 2004, a new expansion team, the Charlotte Bobcats, was established.  After 10 seasons as the Bobcats, the team changed its name to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014\u201315 season, a year after the New Orleans franchise relinquished the Hornets name and renamed itself the Pelicans.  In addition to re-inheriting the Hornets name from New Orleans, the Charlotte franchise reclaimed the history and records of the original 1988\u20132002 Hornets, effectively becoming a continuation of the original franchise. \n\nTyrone Curtis \"Muggsy\" Bogues (born January 9, 1965) is an American retired basketball player.  The shortest player ever to play in the National Basketball Association, the 5 ft Bogues played point guard for four teams during his 14-season career in the NBA.  He is best known for his ten seasons with the Charlotte Hornets, and also played for the Washington Bullets, Golden State Warriors, and Toronto Raptors.  After his NBA career, he served as head coach of the now-defunct WNBA team Charlotte Sting. \n\nThe original Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) were established in 1988 as an expansion team, based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The team's roster was filled with unprotected players at the 1988 NBA Expansion Draft, and five days later the Hornets made their first picks out of college players at the 1988 NBA draft.  The Hornets remained in Charlotte for 14 seasons before relocating to New Orleans in 2002.  Two years after the Hornets' departure, the Charlotte Bobcats were established in 2004.  The Bobcats first participated in the 2004 NBA draft, two days after their expansion draft was held.  The franchise's name was changed back to the Hornets at the conclusion of the 2013\u201314 season, one year after the team in Louisiana renamed itself the New Orleans Pelicans.  The history and records of the original Charlotte Hornets were conveyed to the newly named Charlotte Hornets. \n\nThe 1991\u201392 NBA season was the Charlotte Hornets' fourth season in the National Basketball Association.  With the top overall pick in the 1991 NBA draft, the Hornets selected UNLV star Larry Johnson.  Under new head coach Allan Bristow, the Hornets would get off to a slow start losing 8 of their first 9 games.  At midseason, Rex Chapman was traded to the Washington Bullets as the Hornets would get stronger winning 9 of 13 games in February, on their way to finishing sixth in the Central Division with a record of 31 wins and 51 losses, a five-game improvement over the previous season.  Johnson averaged 19.2 points and 11.0 rebounds per game, as he went on to win the 1992 NBA Rookie of the Year Award.  Second-year star Kendall Gill led the team in scoring with 20.5 points per game.  The Hornets led the NBA in attendance for the third time in four seasons. \n\nThe Charlotte Hornets are an American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The Hornets compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Southeast Division.  The team is largely owned by former NBA player and North Carolina native Michael Jordan, who acquired controlling interest in the team in 2010.  The Hornets play their home games at the Spectrum Center in Uptown Charlotte. \n\nAyana D\u2019Nay Walker (born September 10, 1979) is an American former women's basketball player.  She played for the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters basketball team from 1998 to 2002.  Walker was a member of gold-medal winning USA Basketball Women\u2019s National Team in 2001 and set a USA single-game record with 19 rebounds in gold-medal game.  She was also a member of gold-medal winning USA Basketball World University Games Team in 2001.  Walker was drafted as the 20th overall pick by the Detroit Shock in the 2002 WNBA Draft.  As a member of the Shock, she won the 2003 WNBA Championship.  On July 3, 2005, Walker signed with the Charlotte Sting.  After the Sting franchise folded, Walker was drafted by Los Angeles Sparks as the 12th pick in the dispersal draft on January 8, 2007.  She returned to Detroit for her final season in 2007. \n\nThe Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball team, representing Texas Tech University, has had 9\u00a0players drafted into the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) since the league began holding drafts in 1997.  Sheryl Swoopes was Texas Tech's first player drafted in the WNBA, selected in the 1997 Initial Player Allocation.  The Charlotte Sting had drafted three Lady Raiders, more than any other WNBA franchise: Michi Atkins, in the WNBA Elite Draft, and Angie Braziel and Jia Perkins during the college draft. \n\nThe 2014\u201315 Charlotte Hornets season was the franchise's 25th season in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  This was the team's first year as the Charlotte Hornets since 2002.  The team had been known as the Charlotte Bobcats since its revival in 2004.  However, when the team formally changed its name to the Hornets on May 20, 2014; they also reclaimed the history and records of the original Charlotte Hornets franchise from the 1988\u201389 NBA season through the 2001\u201302 NBA season.  The New Orleans Pelicans retained the remaining history that exists under the New Orleans(/Oklahoma City) Hornets name from the 2002\u201303 NBA season through the 2012\u201313 NBA season.  The team was led by head coach Steve Clifford and assistant coaches Patrick Ewing, Bob Beyer, Stephen Silas, Bob Weiss, and Mark Price. \n\n",

        "context": "The iconic, avant-garde score to the film \"Alien\" was composed by Jerry Goldsmith and is considered by some to be one of his best, most visceral scores.  Rather than focusing on themes, Goldsmith creates a bleak and dissonant soundscape that fits the film's dark and intense atmosphere, with only a few \"romantic\" cues. \n\nChristus Apollo: Cantata Celebrating the Eighth Day of Creation and the Promise of the Ninth is a cantata in four movements for narrator, mezzo-soprano, choir, and orchestra, based on a text by the science fiction author Ray Bradbury and composed by the American composer Jerry Goldsmith.  The piece was commissioned by the California Chamber Symphony in 1969, and premiered later that year in Royce Hall at UCLA with the narration performed by Charlton Heston (who had starred in the 1968 film, \"Planet of the Apes\", for which Goldsmith had composed the musical score). \n\nMulan: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack is the soundtrack for the 1998 Disney animated feature film, \"Mulan\".  Released by Walt Disney Records on June 2, 1998, the album featured songs by Matthew Wilder and David Zippel, conducted by Paul Bogaev, and score composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith.  Vocalists included Lea Salonga, Donny Osmond, 98 Degrees, Jaz Coleman, Stevie Wonder and Christina Aguilera. \n\nLegend: The Music of Jerry Goldsmith is a musical film score by American composer Jerry Goldsmith, released in 1986 for the worldwide release of the film of the same name, (excluding the US).  The album was released on compact disc in 1992 through Silva Screen records and featured alternate cover art and additional songs. \n\nThe score to the 1986 James Cameron film \"Aliens\" was composed by James Horner.  The score itself includes musical references to Gayane's Adagio from Aram Khachaturian's \"Gayane\" ballet suite, which had been used in Stanley Kubrick's \"\" (1968).  The score also uses musical motifs, sound treatments and excerpts from Jerry Goldsmith's original soundtrack to \"Alien\" (1979).  Additional cues taken from Jerry Goldsmith's \"Alien\" score were used in the climax of the film when Horner was unable to finish some cues to Cameron's satisfaction.  The film's editors also reportedly altered the score's chronological flow, sometimes looping, truncating or removing the music and placing it in fragmented form in the film out of context.  Despite production issues, it was nominated for an Academy Award in 1986.  It was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.  The soundtrack album was released the following year, in 1987. \n\nInnerspace is a 1987 American science fiction comedy film directed by Joe Dante and produced by Michael Finnell.  Steven Spielberg served as executive producer.  The film was inspired by the 1966 science fiction film \"Fantastic Voyage\".  It stars Dennis Quaid, Martin Short and Meg Ryan, with Robert Picardo and Kevin McCarthy, with music composed by Jerry Goldsmith.  It earned well over $25 million in its domestic gross revenue and won an Oscar, the only film directed by Dante to do so. \n\nL.A. Confidential is either the original soundtrack, on the Restless Records label featuring mainly songs and source music, or the original film score, on Var\u00e8se Sarabande Records, of the 1997 Academy Award- and Golden Globe Award-winning film \"L.A. Confidential\" starring Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, and Kim Basinger (who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for this film).  The original score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. \n\nStar Trek: Nemesis \u2013 Music from the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is a soundtrack album for the 2002 film, \"\", composed by Jerry Goldsmith.  Released on December 10, 2002 through Var\u00e8se Sarabande, the soundtrack features fourteen tracks of score at a running time just over forty-eight minutes, though bootleg versions containing the entire score have since been released.  A deluxe edition soundtrack limited to 5000 copies was released on January 6, 2014 by Var\u00e8se Sarabande. \n\nTotal Recall is a 1990 American science-fiction action film directed by Paul Verhoeven, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rachel Ticotin, Sharon Stone, Ronny Cox, and Michael Ironside.  The film is loosely based on the Philip K. Dick short story \"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\".  It tells the story of a construction worker who is having troubling dreams about Mars and a mysterious woman there.  It was written by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon, Jon Povill, and Gary Goldman, and won a Special Achievement Academy Award for its visual effects.  The original score composed by Jerry Goldsmith won the BMI Film Music Award. \n\nLionheart, also known as Lionheart: The Children's Crusade, is a 1987 adventure film directed by Franklin J. Schaffner and produced by Talia Shire and Stanley O'Toole.  Shire's brother, Francis Ford Coppola, initially planned to direct the film but instead opted to be executive producer along with Shire's husband, Jack Schwartzman.  The screenplay was written by Menno Meyjes and Richard Outten from a story by Meyjes.  The composer Jerry Goldsmith wrote the score.  The film was released in August 1987.  It was distributed by Orion Pictures. \n\n",

        "context": "Jane Marcus (1938\u20132015) was a pioneering feminist literary scholar, specializing in women writers of the Modernist era, but especially in the social and political context of their writings.  Focusing on Virginia Woolf, Rebecca West, and Nancy Cunard, among many others, she devised groundbreaking analyses of Woolf's writings, upending a generation of criticism that ignored feminist, pacifist, and socialist themes in much of Woolf's work and critique of imperialism and bourgeois society.  Marcus's understanding of Woolf's place within the larger context of English literature has become prevailing wisdom today in the fields affected by her theorization and research, despite the controversial nature of her positions when they were originally formulated and how much opposition she garnered from earlier scholars and critics. \n\nThe Flash Girls are a now defunct folk music duo based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. .  The duo consisted of Emma Bull, a noted science fiction author, and Lorraine Garland, also known as \"The Fabulous Lorraine\".  Garland is also notable as Neil Gaiman's personal assistant; the group formed at a Guy Fawkes Day party at Gaiman's home.  The connections that both Bull and Garland had with the science fiction and fantasy communities allowed them to have an unusually notable group of people writing songs for and with them, including Jane Yolen, Alan Moore, and Neil Gaiman.  These songs are mixed in with their own original works, traditional songs such as Star of the County Down and Lily of the West, as well as poems put to music, including works by Dorothy Parker and A.A. Milne. \n\n\"The Duchess and the Jeweller\" (1938) is a short story by Virginia Woolf.  Woolf, being an advocate of addressing the \"stream of consciousness,\" shows the thoughts and actions of a greedy jeweller; Woolf makes a thematic point that corrupt people do corrupt actions for purely selfish motives (and often without regret).  It was first published in British \"Harper's Bazaar\" Magazine in April 1938 and subsequently published posthumously in 1944 in the collection \"A Haunted House and Other Short Stories. \n\nMe!  I'm Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a 1978 television play by Alan Bennett, produced by London Weekend Television and directed by Stephen Frears.  The title of the play is a parody of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? \", which in turn plays on the title of the Disney song \"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf? \". \n\nOrlando: A Biography is a novel by Virginia Woolf, first published on 11 October 1928.  A high-spirited romp inspired by the tumultuous family history of Woolf's lover and close friend, the aristocratic poet and novelist Vita Sackville-West, it is arguably one of Woolf's most popular novels: a history of English literature in satiric form.  The book describes the adventures of a poet who changes sex from man to woman and lives for centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history.  Considered a feminist classic, the book has been written about extensively by scholars of women's writing and gender and transgender studies. \n\nMoments of Being is a collection of posthumously-published autobiographical essays by Virginia Woolf.  The collection was first found in the papers of her husband, used by Quentin Bell in his biography of Virginia Woolf, published in 1972.  In 1976, the essays were edited for publication by Jeanne Schulkind.  The second edition was published in 1985.  The original texts are now housed at Sussex University and in the British Library in London. \n\nFreshwater is a two-act chamber opera composed by Andy Vores, based on the 1929 comic play by Virginia Woolf.  Vores received assistance in creating the opera from Quentin Bell, Woolf's nephew and executor, who provided a rarely seen earlier version of the text that served as the inspiration for several passages of the libretto. \n\nPamela L. Caughie is a professor and graduate program director in the English Department at Loyola University of Chicago.  As of 2010, she is the president of the Modernist Studies Association.  Caughie received her PhD from the University of Virginia in 1987.  She is also a highly acclaimed Virginia Woolf scholar, and in 2010 was granted a National Endowment for the Humanities grant of $175,000 to continue her work on an electronic edition of Woolf's \"To the Lighthouse\". \n\n\"The Mark on the Wall\" is the first published story by Virginia Woolf.  It was published in 1917 as part of the first collection of short stories written by Virginia Woolf and her husband, Leonard Woolf, called \"Two Stories\".  It was later published in New York in 1921 as part of another collection entitled \"Monday or Tuesday\". \n\nRev Dr \"Jane de Gay\" is a British academic and lecturer who has earned a reputation as an expert on the life and works of Virginia Woolf.  Dr de Gay's works on Woolf include a series of articles and a 2006 book, \"Virginia Woolf's Novels and the Literary Past\", published by Edinburgh University Press.  Her work has been recognised by the Virginia Woolf Society of Great Britain.  She has co-edited four books on gender and theatre, including \"Languages of Theatre Shaped by Women\" (with Lizbeth Goodman). \n\n",

In 1999, Exxon Corporation merged with Mobil to form ExxonMobil.  The \"Exxon\" brand is still used by ExxonMobil's downstream operations as a brand for certain of its gas stations, motor fuel and related products (the highest concentration of which are located in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states).  Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was one of the Seven Sisters that dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s. \n\nThe Oregon and Transcontinental Company was a 19th-century holding company in the United States, organized by Henry Villard in 1881 to control the Northern Pacific Railroad and Oregon Railway and Navigation Company.  It was incorporated in Oregon.  New Jersey passed legislation in 1889 to facilitate the control of other companies by another corporation with a goal of encouraging trusts to convert into holding companies and relocate to that state.  Oregon and Transcontinental in 1890 re-incorporated as a holding company in New Jersey and became the North American Company so that it could take advantage of these expanded corporate powers and invest in a wider range of businesses. \n\nMobil Producing Nigeria (MPN) \"is one of three\" Nigerian subsidiaries of the petroleum company ExxonMobil.

He was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  Berezovsky was politically opposed to the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, since Putin's election in 2000 and remained a vocal critic of Putin for the rest of his life.  In late 2000, after the Russian Deputy Prosecutor General demanded that Berezovsky appear for questioning, he did not return from abroad and moved to the UK, which granted him political asylum in 2003.  In Russia he was later convicted \"in absentia\" of fraud and embezzlement.  The first charges were brought during Primakov's government in 1999.  Despite an Interpol Red Notice for Berezovsky's arrest, Russia repeatedly failed to obtain the extradition of Berezovsky from Britain, which became a major point of diplomatic tension between the two countries. \n\nYvonne Ridley (born 23 April 1958) is a British journalist who was a chair of the National Council of the now defunct Respect Party.

It was the home ground of Wigan Athletic F.C. until the club moved to the new JJB Stadium (now DW Stadium) after the 1998\u201399 season.  At its largest, the stadium held 40,000.  In its 102-year existence the ground only saw 32 years as a Football League venue, 11 years for Wigan Borough F.C. and 21 years for Wigan Athletic FC, before it was demolished to make way for a housing estate in 1999. \n\nThe Trinidad and Tobago League Cup, or commonly known as the First Citizens Cup for sponsorship reasons, is the league cup style football competition open for Trinidad and Tobago teams competing in the country's TT Pro League.  Similar to the FA Trophy, it is played on a knockout (single elimination) basis in September and October towards the beginning of each Pro League season.  Unlike the FA Trophy, where 36 teams enter each season from the top three tiers of the Trinidad and Tobago football league system and the Secondary Schools Football League, only teams from the TT Pro League compete in the league cup.  The knockout tournament was inaugurated in 2000 and is currently sponsored by First Citizens Bank.  Although the league cup is one of the three major domestic trophies attainable by Trinidad and Tobago league teams, it is perceived as a lower priority than the league championship and the FA Trophy.  The current theme is \"Where Winners Reign\", with TT$110,000 to the winner, TT$20,000 to the runners-up, semifinal winners receive TT$7,000, quaterfinal winners receive TT$5,000 and Play-off round winners receive TT$3,000. \n\nDuring the 2002\u201303 English football season, Wigan Athletic F.C. competed in the Football League Second Division. \n\nDuring the 2004\u201305 English football season, Wigan Athletic F.C. competed in the Football League Championship. \n\nThe 2007\u201308 Wigan Athletic F.C. season was the club's 30th season in the Football League and their third season in the Premier League. \n\nNicholas Edward \"Nick\" Powell (born 23 March 1994) is an English professional footballer who plays for Wigan Athletic as a midfielder.  He began his career at Crewe Alexandra, initially as a forward, making his debut at the age of 16.  After impressing for Crewe Alexandra during the 2011\u201312 season, including scoring in their 2\u20130 victory in the League Two play-off Final, he moved to Manchester United in July 2012.  Unable to break into the Manchester United first team, however, he went on loan to Wigan Athletic, Leicester City and Hull City before being released in June 2016.  He joined Wigan Athletic in July 2016.  He has represented England at under-16, under-17, under-18, under-19 and under-21 levels. \n\nThe 1978\u201379 season was the 41st season in the history of Wigan Athletic F.C. and their first as a professional club in the Football League.  After finishing 2nd in the Northern Premier League during the previous season, the club was nominated to apply for Football League status, and were elected into the league to replace Southport.  After a poor start, the club exceeded expectations in the league, and towards the end of the season, a second consecutive promotion seemed possible.  The club eventually fell short, finishing the season in 6th place with a total of 55 points. \n\nThe 1979\u201380 season was the 42nd season in the history of Wigan Athletic F.C. and their second as a professional club in the Football League. \n\nWigan Borough F.C. was an English football club based in the town of Wigan.  The club was founded in 1920 and joined the Lancashire Combination.  In 1921, Borough turned professional when their application was accepted to play in the inaugural season of the newly formed Football League Third Division North.  The team played in the Football League for ten seasons, with their most successful season coming in 1928\u201329, finishing fourth in the league and reaching the third round of the FA Cup.  Wigan Borough folded during the 1931\u201332 season due to financial problems, and League football did not return to the town until Wigan Athletic F.C. were elected into the Football League in 1978. \n\n",

Along with other prominent DC Comics superhero sidekicks, he goes on to become a core member of the superhero group the Teen Titans.  As an adult, Roy casts off his Speedy identity to establish himself as the superhero Arsenal, and for a time adopts the name Red Arrow to symbolise his having become an equal of Green Arrow.

The holiday was created by Belizean civil rights activist, Thomas Vincent Ramos, in 1941.  It was recognized as a public holiday in the southern districts of Belize in 1943, and declared a national holiday in 1977.  The holiday celebrates the settlement of the Garifuna people in Belize after being exiled from the Grenadines by the British army.  The major festivities for the holiday occur in the town of Dangriga, including parades, street music, and traditional dancing. \n\nWhite Sunday is a national holiday in Samoa falling on the second Sunday of October, with the Monday following a public holiday.

The boys wear a long black shirt, trousers and txapela (traditional black beret).  The casera outfits are normally dark blue, but can come in many colors.  They wear caseras because that is what the people of the mountain wear and the holiday used to celebrate the peasants who sold their goods in town and came on Santo Tomas to pay rent to landlords in the city. \n\nThe Eighth was a federal holiday in the United States from 1828 until 1861.  It honored the Battle of New Orleans, which took place on January 8, 1815, with Tennessee's Andrew Jackson leading a successful battle against regular British soldiers and freed slaves.  The holiday was celebrated widely across the US South after this final battle in the War of 1812.  \"The Eighth\" became an official national holiday in 1828, following Jackson's election as President.  The Eighth continued as an official national holiday from 1828 until the advent of the American Civil War. \n\nJounen Kw\u00e9y\u00f2l (Creole Day) is celebrated in Saint Lucia on the last Sunday of October across the entire island, and has been held annually since 1984.  On the Sunday of this week, the various towns chosen to host this festival put out the result of their grand preparations; local dishes and foods such as roast breadfruit, Green Fig and Salt Fish (The National Dish of Saint Lucia), plantain, king fish, Manicou (opossum), Souse (a soup made with pork and often cucumber), fried bake and floats, Accra (a fried dough which contains salt fish), Paime (otherwise known as Conkies) and a famous dish known as Bouillon (fish, chicken or meat stewed with dasheen, yams, plantains, banana and dumplings) Also local drinks such as Cocoa Tea, Golden Apple Juice, Guava Juice and more.  Apart from the food part, the event is collaborated with kweyol music some of which have been past down to and from many generations.  The most widely used instrument besides vocals are the Tambos (drums) and are beaten throughout as people speak in the creole language and have a merry time.  Most people commemorate this day by wearing the island's National Wear such as the Wob Dwiete.  Persons who do not want to wear the extreme layers of skirts and dresses make clothing out of special plaid material called Madras which is one of the cloths used in the national wear.  Among the places which celebrate it every year are Mon Repos and Dennery. \n\nSaint-Jean-Baptiste Day (French: \"F\u00eate de la Saint-Jean-Baptiste\" ), officially known in Quebec as the National Holiday, (French: \"la f\u00eate nationale\" ) is a holiday celebrated annually on June 24, the feast day of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist.  In Quebec, it is a public holiday with festivities occurring on June 23 and 24 which are publicly financed and organized by a \"Comit\u00e9 organisateur de la f\u00eate nationale\" (National Holiday Organizing Committee).

        "context": "James Gunn (born August 5) is an American screenwriter, director, producer, novelist, actor, and musician.  He started his career as a screenwriter in the mid-1990s, writing the scripts for \"Tromeo and Juliet\" (1996), \"Scooby-Doo\" (2002) and its sequel \"\" (2004), and the 2004 version of \"Dawn of the Dead\".  He then started working also as a director, starting with \"Slither\" (2006).  He subsequently wrote and directed the web series \"James Gunn's PG Porn\", and the superhero films \"Super\" (2010), \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" (2014) and \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.  2\" (2017). \n\nTromeo and Juliet is a 1996 American independent transgressive romantic comedy film and a loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Romeo & Juliet\" from Troma Entertainment.  The film was directed by Lloyd Kaufman from a screenplay by Kaufman and James Gunn, who also served as associate director. \n\nRomeo \u00d7 Juliet (\u30ed\u30df\u30aa\u00d7\u30b8\u30e5\u30ea\u30a8\u30c3\u30c8 , Romio to Jurietto ) is an anime television series, loosely based on William Shakespeare's classical play, \"Romeo and Juliet\", along with numerous references and characters from other Shakespearean plays.  Though the anime borrows mostly from Shakespeare's story, the manga adaptation differs extensively from the original.  \"Romeo \u00d7 Juliet\" was broadcast in Japan on Chubu-Nippon, broadcasting from April 4, 2007 to September 26, 2007.  In 2009, \"Romeo \u00d7 Juliet\" was dubbed into English and released by Funimation Entertainment. \n\nWilliam Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet may be one of the most-screened plays of all time.  The most notable theatrical releases were George Cukor's multi-Oscar-nominated 1936 production \"Romeo and Juliet\", Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film \"Romeo and Juliet\", and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired \"Romeo + Juliet\".  The latter two were both, at the time, the highest-grossing Shakespeare films.  Cukor featured the mature actors Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard as the teenage lovers while Zeffirelli populated his film with beautiful young people, and Baz Luhrmann produced a heavily cut fast-paced version aimed at teenage audiences. \n\n\"Romeo \u00d7 Juliet\" (\u30ed\u30df\u30aa\u00d7\u30b8\u30e5\u30ea\u30a8\u30c3\u30c8 , Romio to Jurietto ) is a 24-episode anime television adaptation of \"Romeo and Juliet\", a 16th-century tragedy originally written by William Shakespeare.  The English playwright himself makes a cameo appearance in the series as a minor character.  The series was produced jointly by Gonzo and SKY Perfect Well Think, with Fumitoshi Oizaki as the main director.  It was first broadcast in Japan on Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting between April 4, 2007 and September 26, 2007.  It was later broadcast by other Japanese television networks such as TBS, KBS Ky\u014dto and SUN-TV.  It was broadcast in Hungary by Animax and in Italy by Rai 4.  The chief screenwriter for the series was Reiko Yoshida.  The music was composed by Hitoshi Sakimoto and performed by Eminence Symphony Orchestra with Tomohiro Yoshida as sound director.  The series used three pieces of theme music.  The opening theme was \"Inori (You Raise Me Up)\" (\u7948\u308a \u301cYou Raise Me Up\u301c ) by Lena Park.  \"Cyclone\" (\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30ed\u30f3) ) by 12012 was the ending theme for the first 14 episodes.  \"Good Bye, Yesterday\" by Mizrock was the ending theme for episodes 15 to 23.  \"Inori: You Raise Me Up\" by Lena Park was used as a special ending for episode 24.  The anime is licensed in North America by Funimation.  The complete series was released in two sections, with the first half of the series, the \"Romeo Collection\" being released June 23, 2009 and the second half of the series, the \"Juliet Collection\" being released August 11, 2009. \n\n\"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet\" is a popular reference to William Shakespeare's play \"Romeo and Juliet\", in which Juliet seems to argue that it does not matter that Romeo is from her rival's house of Montague, that is, that he is named \"Montague.\"  The reference is often used to imply that the names of things do not affect what they really are.  This formulation is, however, a paraphrase of Shakespeare's actual language, seen underlined below.  This scene is called the balcony scene by many people.  Juliet not only makes the statement above but compares Romeo to a rose saying that if he wasn't named Romeo he would still be handsome and be Juliet's Love.  Also as said before this states that if he wasn't Romeo, then he wouldn't be a Montague and she would be able to get married with no problem at all. \n\nJames Gunn's PG Porn is a web series created by brothers James Gunn, Brian Gunn, and Sean Gunn.  It consists of a series of pornography spoofs, with a humorous event occurring just before the supposed commencement of pornographic sexual acts.  Each episode pairs a mainstream actor with a pornographic actress or model.  The tagline is, \"For people who love everything about Porn...except the sex.\" \n\nRomeo Montague (Italian: \"Romeo Montecchi\" ) is the protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\".  The son of Montague and his wife, he secretly loves and marries Juliet, a member of the rival House of Capulet.  Forced into exile after slaying Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, in a duel, Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet's death. \n\nWilliam Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet (shortened to Romeo + Juliet) is a 1996 American romantic drama film directed, co-produced, and co-written by Baz Luhrmann, co-produced by Gabriella Martinelli, and co-written by Craig Pearce, being an adaptation and modernization of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\".  The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the leading roles of Romeo and Juliet, who instantly fall in love when Romeo crashes a party and meets her, despite their being members of the Montague and Capulet family; Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino, and Diane Venora star in supporting roles. \n\nThe Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet is a 1982 film adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", directed by William Woodman and starring Alex Hyde-White as Romeo and Blanche Baker as Juliet. \n\n",

His father had wanted to name him Marion Barry III, but Effi was strongly opposed, and they decided to give him the middle name Christopher instead.  For most of his adult life, Barry went by his middle name, Christopher. \n\nChristopher Funk is an American musician and multi-instrumentalist best known as a member of the Portland, Oregon, indie rock band The Decemberists.  He plays guitar, pedal steel, piano, violin, dobro, hurdy-gurdy, mandolin, saxophone, the theremin and many other instruments.  According to Colin Meloy, as stated at the Pilgrimage Festival in Franklin, TN on September 27, 2015, Funk was originally given the middle name \"Ryman\" but a clerical error on his birth certificate resulted in his middle name being recorded as \"Lyman.\" \n\nJeff Strabone is a Brooklyn-based American scholar, political activist and civic leader.  In 2016, his website \"directelection.org\" listed the names and addresses of members of the U.S. Electoral College, and he urged people to write to electors to ask them not to vote for president-elect Donald Trump, an effort which brought him national attention.  As a civic leader in Brooklyn, he has been active in promoting theatre preservation, building codes and housing issues, hospital preservation, and traffic flow.  He has been a leader of Brooklyn's Cobble Hill Association, a neighborhood preservation group.  He is the co-founder and chairman of the New Brooklyn Theatre.  In 2008, he changed his middle name to \"Hussein\" as a show of solidarity with then presidential candidate Barack Obama, who was running for the office of president, and who had been criticized for his Muslim-sounding middle name.  He is an associate professor of English and teaches British and African literature, and he was granted tenure at Connecticut College in 2016.

It aired on CBS on October 3, 2004. \n\nLatvian names, like in most European cultures, consist of two main elements: the given name (\"v\u0101rds\") followed by family name (\"uzv\u0101rds\").  During the Soviet occupation (1940 - 1991) the practice of giving a middle name was discouraged, but since the restoration of Independence Latvian legislation again allows giving of up to two given names and it has become more common to give a middle name to children. \n\nIn several cultures, people's names usually include one or more names in addition to the portion that is usually considered adequate to identify them.  In a number of cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, such a name is likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname, and thus called a middle name.  In English-speaking American culture, that term is often applied (arguably mistakenly) to names, occupying that position, even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a \"middle name\", and is actually (to mention several types of atypical cases): \n\nBarend or (somewhat dated spelling) Barent is a Dutch male given name and occasional middle name.  As of 2014, there are over than 4,000 men in the Netherlands with this as their first name, and nearly 3,000 with it as their middle name.  It was likely derived from Bernard.  Notable people with the name include: \n\nSingh is a title, middle name or surname, which originated in India.  Derived from the Sanskrit word for lion, it was adopted as a title by certain warrior castes in India.  It was mandated by Guru Gobind Singh for all Sikhs.  It was later adopted by several castes and communities.  As a surname or a middle name, it is now found throughout the Indian subcontinent and among the Indian diaspora, cutting across communities and religious groups, becoming more of a title than a surname. \n\nMilhouse Mussolini van Houten is a fictional character featured in the animated television series \"The Simpsons\", voiced by Pamela Hayden, and created by Matt Groening who named the character after President Richard Nixon's middle name.

        "context": "The Embassy of China in London is the diplomatic mission of China in the United Kingdom.  The Embassy in London is China's only embassy in the UK, alongside two Consulates-General in Edinburgh and Manchester.  Established in 1877 as the Chinese Legation, the London mission was China's first permanent overseas diplomatic mission.  It has served as the diplomatic mission of the Qing Empire, Republic of China and (since 1950) the People's Republic of China.  It was the location of the Qing Empire's detention of Sun Yat-sen, an important episode in the Chinese revolution of 1911.  It remains today the focal point for events relating to China held in the United Kingdom, including celebrations in 2012 to commemorate 40 years of diplomatic relations between the UK and the People's Republic of China. \n\nA diplomatic mission or foreign mission is a group of people from one state or an organisation present in another state to represent the sending state/organisation officially in the receiving state.  In practice, a diplomatic mission usually denotes the resident mission, namely the embassy, which is the office of a country's diplomatic representatives in the capital city of another country, whereas consulates are diplomatic missions which are not performed in the capital of the receiving state.  As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries.  There are thus resident and non-resident embassies. \n\nIn diplomatic usage, head of mission (HOM) or chief of mission (COM) from the French \"chef de mission diplomatique\" (CMD) is the head of a diplomatic representation, such as an ambassador, high commissioner, nuncio, charg\u00e9 d'affaires, permanent representative, and to a consul-general or consul.  Depending on the context, it may also refer to the heads of certain international organizations' representative offices.  Certain other titles or usages that would qualify as a head of mission or equivalent also exist.  While they are primarily referred to by the other titles mentioned above, it is common for the diplomatic corps of several countries to use deputy head of mission or deputy chief of mission (DCM) as the primary title for the second in command of a diplomatic mission. \n\nA diplomatic bag, also known as a diplomatic pouch, is a container with certain legal protections used for carrying official correspondence or other items between a diplomatic mission and its home government or other diplomatic, consular, or otherwise official entities.  The physical concept of a \"diplomatic bag\" is flexible and therefore can take many forms (e.g., a cardboard box, briefcase, duffel bag, large suitcase, crate or even a shipping container).  Additionally, a diplomatic bag usually has some form of lock and/or tamper-evident seal attached to it in order to deter or detect interference by unauthorized third parties.  The most important point is that as long as it is externally marked to show its status, the \"bag\" has diplomatic immunity from search or seizure, as codified in article 27 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  It may only contain articles intended for official use.  It is often escorted by a diplomatic courier, who is similarly immune from arrest and detention. \n\nThe High Commission of Australia in London is the diplomatic mission of Australia in the United Kingdom.  It is located in Australia House, a Grade II listed building.  It is both Australia's first diplomatic mission and the longest continuously occupied diplomatic mission in the United Kingdom. \n\nAlvaro Mexia was a 17th-century Spanish explorer and cartographer of the east coast of Florida.  Mexia was stationed in St Augustine and was given a diplomatic mission to the native populations living south of St. Augustine and in the Cape Canaveral area.  This mission resulted in a \"Period of Friendship\" between the Spanish and the Ais native population. \n\nThe Embassy of Algeria in Islamabad is the diplomatic mission of Algeria to Pakistan.  It is located at House No. 107, St. No. 9, in Sector E-7, Islamabad.  Pakistan was one of the first countries to recognise the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic in 1958.  This was followed shortly later by Algeria opening its diplomatic mission in Karachi, then the capital of Pakistan. \n\nThe Embassy of the United States of America to Kenya (also known as Embassy Nairobi by the State Department), located in Nairobi, is home to the diplomatic mission of the United States to the Republic of Kenya.  The embassy opened in central Nairobi in 1964, when the United States established diplomatic relations with Kenya.  In 1998, the original embassy was the target of a terrorist attack, after which a new embassy building was constructed in Gigiri, a suburb of Nairobi, in 2003.  The US diplomatic mission to Somalia is also based at the Nairobi embassy. \n\nThe United States Mission to the European Union (USEU) is the diplomatic mission of the United States to the European Union; it is based in Brussels, Belgium.  The US has maintained diplomatic relations with the EU and its predecessors since 1953.  The first predecessor of the current mission was the US diplomatic mission to the European Coal and Steel Community in Luxembourg, which opened in 1956.  In 1961, the US Mission to the European Communities was established in Brussels, which later became the United States Mission to the European Union, upon the latter's establishment in 1993. \n\nAlthough Azerbaijan initiated diplomatic relations with Western and other countries since the Safavids dynasty in XVI century, the first diplomatic body - the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was established in 1918 when Azerbaijan was formed as a republic for the first time and Mehmet Hasan Hac\u0131nkski became the first minister.  The parliament sent the diplomatic delegation to the Ottoman State after signing the first international document - the Pact of Peace and Friendship - with this state and on this agreement, the Ottoman State became the first country recognizing independence of the ADR.  The next step, the \"Friendship and Peace\" treaty with Iran was signed on 20 March 1919.  And the diplomatic mission of Azerbaijan had started to work as a consulate in Tehran and other cities.  However, this successful revival continued until the Russian army entered Baku on April 28, 1920.  The diplomatic delegation of the Republic attended the Paris Peace Conference, 1919.  As a result of the national democratic movement that started in Azerbaijan in 1988-1990, the country restored its independence on 5 February, 1991.  Afterwards, Azerbaijan started to create bilateral relations with other countries.  In this regard, the diplomatic missions have been established in foreign countries.  Today Azerbaijan has embassies and consulates in more than 70 countries.  Recent diplomatic missions started to operate in Brasil, Australia and Vietnam. \n\n",

        "context": "Network Analysis and Ethnographic Problems: Process Models of a Turkish Nomad Clan is an anthropological and complexity science book by social anthropologists Douglas R. White, University of California, Irvine, and Ulla Johansen of the University of Cologne.  It is considered an important publication in anthropology and the political science of Central Asia. \n\nParticipant observation is one type of data collection method typically used in qualitative research.  It is a widely used methodology in many disciplines, particularly cultural anthropology and (European) ethnology, less so in sociology, communication studies, human geography and social psychology.  Its aim is to gain a close and intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals (such as a religious, occupational, sub cultural group, or a particular community) and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their cultural environment, usually over an extended period of time.  The method originated in the field research of social anthropologists, especially Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski and his students in Britain, the students of Franz Boas in the United States, and in the later urban research of the Chicago School of sociology. \n\nSocial Anthropology/Anthropologie Sociale is a quarterly academic journal published since 2007 by Wiley-Blackwell on behalf of the European Association of Social Anthropologists.  It was established in 1992 and originally published by Cambridge University Press.  The current editors-in-chief are Sarah Green and Patrick Laviolette.  Articles are published in English or French. \n\nMuted group theory (MGT) is developed by social anthropologists Edwin Ardener and Shirley Ardener in 1975.  The theory describes the relationship between a dominant group and its subordinate group(s): As the dominant group contributes mostly to the formulation of the language system, including the norms and vocabulary, members from the subordinate group have to learn and use the dominant-made language to express themselves.  However, this translation process may result in loss and distortion of information as the people from subordinate groups cannot articulate their ideas clearly.  The dominant may also ignore the voice of the lower-power.  All these may eventually lead to the mutedness of the subordinate group.  Although this theory is initially developed to study the different situations faced by women and men, it can also be applied to any marginalized group that is muted by the inadequacies of their languages. \n\nSymbolic culture is the ability to learn and transmit behavioural traditions from one generation to the next by the invention of things that exist entirely in the symbolic realm.  Symbolic culture is the cultural realm constructed and inhabited uniquely by Homo sapiens and is differentiated from ordinary culture, which many other animals possess.  Symbolic culture is studied by archaeologists, social anthropologists and sociologists. \n\nThe Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth, is a learned society in the United Kingdom dedicated to promoting the academic discipline of psychosocial studies.  It is a member of the Academy of Social Sciences. \n\nAleksandar Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 is a social anthropologist from former Yugoslavia, who published twelve books and several hundred articles and book reviews on history and theory of anthropology, from a transactionalist and comparative perspective.  He is Professor in the Department of Ethnology and Anthropology (University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy), and Professor of Anthropology at the University of Donja Gorica in Montenegro.  Since 2 February 2017, Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 also heads the Department of Anthropological Research (within the Center for Sociological and Anthropological Studies) at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade, where he is Director of Research, and former (19 May 2009- 1 February 2017) Head of the Center for Political Studies and Public Opinion Research.  Aleksandar Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 previously taught at the Universities of St Andrews (1994), Belgrade (then Yugoslavia, 1998), Bras\u00edlia (Brazil, 1999-2001), University of the Witwatersrand (Johannesburg, South Africa, 2001-2003), and Rhodes University (Grahamstown, South Africa, 2003-2006).  Between 2000 and 2014, Aleksandar Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 was teaching in the Post-graduate Program in Anthropology of the Faculty of Social Sciences (FDV), University of Ljubljana (Slovenia).  Just before the 2016 conference of the European Association of Social Anthropologists, held at the University of Milano-Bicocca, he was selected as the EASA Book Series Editor.  Together with Han Vermeulen, he is co-convenor of the recently established History of Anthropology Network of the EASA. \n\nCoral Gardens and Their Magic, properly Coral Gardens and Their Magic: A Study of the Methods of Tilling the Soil and of Agricultural Rites in the Trobriand Islands, is the final book in anthropologist Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski's ethnographic trilogy on the lives of the Trobriand Islanders.  It concentrates on the cultivation practices the Trobriand Islanders used to grow yams, taro, bananas and palms.  It describes the gardens in which the Trobrianders grew food as more than merely utilitarian spaces, even as works of art.  In 1988 Alfred Gell called the book \"still the best account of any primitive technological-cum-magical system, and unlikely ever to be superseded in this respect\".  The book has been described as Malinowski's \"magnum opus\". \n\nAlfred Antony Francis Gell, {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} ( ; June 12, 1945 \u2013 January 28, 1997) was a British social anthropologist whose most influential work concerned art, language, symbolism and ritual.  He was trained by Edmund Leach (MPhil, Cambridge University) and Raymond Firth (PhD, London School of Economics) and did his fieldwork in Melanesia and tribal India.  Gell taught at the London School of Economics, among other places.  He was also a Fellow of the British Academy.  He died of cancer in 1997, at the age of 51. \n\nThomas Hylland Eriksen (born February 6, 1962) is a Norwegian anthropologist.  He is currently a professor of social anthropology at the University of Oslo, as well as the 2015-2016 president of the European Association of Social Anthropologists.  He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. \n\n",

The library occupies a single-story wood frame structure built in 1845 as a church for a Universalist congregation.  Despite significant alteration for its use as a library, the building remains a fine example of vernacular church architecture in Sullivan County.  The building was formally dedicated in 1927 to the memory of Lempster native Alonzo Ames Miner, a leading Universalist minister and president of Tufts College.  After years of declining attendance, the remaining congregants gave the building to the town in 1965.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. \n\nDover is a city in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States.  The population was 29,987 at the 2010 census, the largest in the New Hampshire Seacoast region.  The population was estimated at 31,153 in 2016.  It is the county seat of Strafford County, and home to Wentworth-Douglass Hospital, the Woodman Institute Museum, and the Children's Museum of New Hampshire. \n\nCarroll County is a county located in the state of New Hampshire, in the United States.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 47,818, making it the third-least populous county in New Hampshire.  Its county seat is Ossipee.  The county was created in 1840 and organized at Ossipee from towns removed from Strafford County.  It was named in honor of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, who had died in 1832, the last surviving signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. \n\nHampden County is a non-governmental county located in the Pioneer Valley of the state of Massachusetts, in the United States.  As of the 2010 census, Hampden County's population was 463,490.  Its traditional county seat is Springfield, the Connecticut River Valley's largest city, and economic and cultural capital.  Hampden County was split from Hampshire County in 1812, because Northampton, Massachusetts, was made Hampshire County's \"shire town\" in 1794; however, Springfield\u2014theretofore Hampshire County's traditional shire town, dating back to its founding in 1636\u2014grew at a pace far quicker than Northampton and was granted shire town-status over its own, southerly jurisdiction.  It was named for John Hampden.  To the north of Hampden County is modern-day Hampshire County; to the west is Berkshire County; to the east is Worcester County; to the south are Litchfield County, Hartford County, and Tolland County in Connecticut. \n\nWoodsville is a census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Haverhill in Grafton County, New Hampshire, U.S., along the Connecticut River at the mouth of the Ammonoosuc River.  The population was 1,126 at the 2010 census.  Although North Haverhill is now the county seat of Grafton County, the village of Woodsville has traditionally been considered the county seat, as the county courthouse was originally located there.  The county buildings are now located halfway between Woodsville and the village of North Haverhill to the south. \n\nLempster is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States.  The population was 1,154 at the 2010 census.  Settlements include the town center (Lempster village) and the village of East Lempster. \n\nEssex County is a county in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Vermont.

It is south of the Canadian province of Quebec. \n\nThe Gardnerville Branch Jail is a historic jail located at 1440 Courthouse St. in Gardnerville, Nevada.  The jail was built in 1910 and served as Douglas County's only jail from 1910 to 1915.  Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary.  As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail.  However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself.  Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail.  The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him.  Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail. \n\nSteven \"Steve\" Smith (born June 23, 1964) is a New Hampshire politician and a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives representing Sullivan County District 11, which includes the towns of Acworth, Charlestown, Goshen, Langdon, Lempster, and Washington.

The position is held by a senior member of one of the three main branches of the Canadian Armed Forces.  The current CDS, since 17 July 2015, is Jonathan Vance. \n\nOne Rank One Pension (OROP), or \"same pension, for same rank, for same length of service, irrespective of the date of retirement\", is a longstanding demand of the Indian armed forces and veterans.  The demand for pay-pension equity, which underlies the OROP concept, was provoked by the exparte decision by the Indira Gandhi-led Indian National Congress (INC) government, in 1973, two years after the historic victory in the 1971 Bangladesh war, and shortly after Field Marshal SHFJ Manekshaw retired, to decrease armed forces pensions by 20\u201340 percent, and increase civilian pensions by 20 percent, without consultation with armed forces headquarters.  <ref name=\"V Mahalingam, 21/9\"> </ref> \n\nThe Military Covenant or Armed Forces Covenant is a term introduced in 2000 into British public life to refer to the mutual obligations between the nation and its Armed Forces.  According to \"The Guardian\", \"it is an informal understanding, rather than a legally enforceable deal, but it is nevertheless treated with great seriousness within the services\".  It was coined in , and has now entered political discourse as a way of measuring whether the government and society at large have kept to their obligations to support members of the armed forces. \n\nFernando Tapias Stahelin (born July 14, 1943 - \u2020 September 27, 2015) was a General (retired) of Colombian Armed Forces.  He served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of Colombian Armed Forces for a period of four years (1998\u20132002) during the presidential term of president Andres Pastrana.  After that, he served as ambassador of Colombia in Dominican Republic from 2002 to 2004 and subsequently served as Deputy Minister of Defense for its social and business group for two years from 2009 to 2010 during the presidential term of president Alvaro Uribe.  He was in the Colombian Armed Forces for 41 years, achieving all the military ranks all the way up to his appointment as General Commander for the Colombian Armed Forces. \n\nIn June 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which created the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC).  It was the most important federal move in support of the rights of African-Americans between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The President's order stated that the federal government would not hire any person based on their race, color, creed, or national origin.  The FEPC enforced the order to ban discriminatory hiring within the federal government and in corporations that received federal contracts.  Millions of blacks and women achieved better jobs and better pay as a result.  The war brought the race issue to the forefront.  The Army and Navy had been segregated since the Civil War.  But by 1940, the African-American vote had largely shifted from Republican to Democrat, and African-American leaders like Walter Francis White of the NAACP and T. Arnold Hill of the Urban League had become recognized as part of the Roosevelt coalition.  In June 1941, at the urging of A. Philip Randolph, the leading African-American trade unionist, Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the Fair Employment Practice Committee and prohibiting discrimination by any government agency, including the armed forces.  In practice the services, particularly the Navy and the Marines, found ways to evade this order \u2014 the Marine Corps remained all-white until 1942.  In September 1942, at Eleanor's instigation, Roosevelt met with a delegation of African-American leaders, who demanded full integration into the forces, including the right to serve in combat roles and in the Navy, the Marine Corps and the United States Army Air Forces.  Roosevelt agreed, but then did nothing to implement his promise.  It was left to his successor, Harry S. Truman, to fully desegregate the armed forces. \n\nArmed Forces Day, known also as the Feast of the Polish Armed Forces (Polish: \"\u015awi\u0119to Wojska Polskiego\" ), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over Soviet Russia at the Battle of Warsaw during the Polish\u2013Soviet War.  Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, itself a separate public holiday.  The event is marked by military parades, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the Polish Armed Forces across the country.  One of the most prominent events of the day is in the capital Warsaw, which hosts a large military parade through the city's center.  Originally celebrated during the Second Republic, the holiday was barred by authorities during the communist era beginning in 1947, only to be revived again in 1992. \n\nThe 2010 Kiev Victory Day Parade was held on May 9, 2010 in Kiev, honoring the 65th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory in the Great Patriotic War.  Inspecting the parade was the Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces General of the Army Ivan Svyda.  The commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Colonel General Gennady Vorobyov, Commanded the Parade.  The President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych delivered a jubilee address.  2,500 members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces troops from Russia and Belarus took part in the parade.  17 military orchestras took part in the parade under the command of the Chief of the Military Music Department of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Major General Volodymyr Derkach. \n\nConscription in the United States, commonly known as the draft, has been employed by the federal government of the United States in four conflicts: the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean and Vietnam Wars).  The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act.  It was the country's first peacetime draft.  From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means.  The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force.  However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed. \n\nRostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981) , was a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional.  After extensive hearings, floor debate and committee sessions on the matter, the United States Congress enacted the law, as it had previously been, to apply to men only.  Several attorneys, including Robert L. Goldberg, subsequently challenged the gender distinction as unconstitutional.  (The named defendant is Bernard D. Rostker, Director of the Selective Service System.)  In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that this gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and that the Act would stand as passed. \n\nThe 16 September military parade in honour of the anniversary of Mexican Independence is an annual tradition dating back to the late 19th century and the beginning of the professionalisation of the Mexican Armed Forces in the 20th century.  Held yearly in the Z\u00f3calo in Mexico City, this parade, the largest of the various parades held simultaneously nationwide on September 16, Mexican Independence Day, is presided by the President of Mexico in the fulfillment of his duty as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.  It is also attended by members of the Cabinet of Mexico, the Congress of the Union, civil service employees, the Secretaries of National Defense and Navy, members of the Mexican Armed Forces and Federal Police, uniformed service veterans, the state diplomatic corps, delegations representing the religious sector, indigenous peoples, sports and the private sector, and the general public.  Seen on TV and the Internet and heard on radio, this is one of the biggest events of the year.  Taking part in this are members of the Mexican Armed Forces and the Federal Police. \n\n",

PepsiCo has interests in the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of grain-based snack foods, beverages, and other products.  PepsiCo was formed in 1965 with the merger of the Pepsi-Cola Company and Frito-Lay, Inc.  PepsiCo has since expanded from its namesake product Pepsi to a broader range of food and beverage brands, the largest of which included an acquisition of Tropicana Products in 1998 and the Quaker Oats Company in 2001, which added the Gatorade brand to its portfolio. \n\nRewrapped is a reality cooking television show hosted by Joey Fatone that premiered on April 21, 2014, on Food Network.

Fabiani (born 1957) is an American political strategist, crisis management expert, former Deputy Mayor of Los Angeles and chief of staff to Mayor Tom Bradley, and former White House lawyer and spokesman.  He is recognized for his work as special counsel to President Bill Clinton and legal spokesperson for the Clinton White House from 1994 through 1996, as well as for his work as head of communications for the Gore presidential campaign in 2000.  He also served in senior positions at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and at the Department of Justice. \n\nMonica Samille Lewinsky (born July 23, 1973) is an American activist, television personality, fashion designer, and former White House intern. \n\nThe White House Doctor: My Patients Were Presidents \u2013 A Memoir is a book authored by Connie Mariano, the first military woman in the history of the United States to be appointed as Physician to the President, the first female director of the medical unit of the White House, and the first Filipino-American to become a rear admiral in the US Navy.  With a foreword from Bill Clinton, the autobiographical book takes a look at the personal lives of three American Presidents (George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush) and three American First Ladies (Barbara Bush, Hillary Clinton, and Laura Bush) she had taken care of while working as a White House physician.  It was described as a \"fascinating look into what goes on behind closed doors at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue\". \n\nGregory Bestor \"Greg\" Craig (born March 4, 1945) is an American lawyer and former White House Counsel under President Barack Obama from 2009 to 2010.  A former attorney at the Washington, D.C. law firm of Williams & Connolly, Craig has represented numerous high-profile clients.  Prior to becoming White House Counsel, Craig served as assistant to the President and special counsel in the White House of President Bill Clinton, where he directed the team defending Clinton against impeachment.  Craig also served as a senior advisor to Senator Edward Kennedy and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. \n\nTheir Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine is a book by Candice E. Jackson.  Published by conservative publisher World Ahead Publishing on May 31, 2005, it recounts the stories of seven women who crossed paths with Bill Clinton: Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers, Kathleen Willey, Elizabeth Gracen, Juanita Broaddrick, and Sally Perdue. \n\nEric Schultz is a senior advisor to former President Barack Obama and is the founder of Schultz Group.  Schultz is a former White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary and special assistant to President Obama.  Recognized by \"Politico\" as the strategist \u201cWhite House officials turn to in a crisis to handle communications,\u201d Schultz was originally hired at the White House in 2011 to respond to Congressional oversight investigations.  After White House Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest replaced Jay Carney to become White House Press Secretary, Schultz was appointed White House Deputy Press Secretary.  In this role, Schultz often diffuses \"tensions with humor.  But he can be relentless in pushing his message in both public and private conversations.\u201d  Former White House Communications Director Jen Psaki compared Schultz to fictional crisis manager Olivia Pope, \"he's the person you want next to you in a foxhole when there's a crisis.\"  At the end of President Obama's second term, former White House Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett said of Schultz, \u201cWe\u2019ve all grown to rely on his wise counsel\" and that the President \"trusts his sound judgement.\" \n\nThe Lewinsky scandal was an American political sex scandal that involved 49-year-old President Bill Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky.  The sexual relationship took place between 1995 and 1996 and came to light in 1998.  Clinton ended a televised speech with the statement that he did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky.  Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives.  He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial.  Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the Paula Jones case regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright.  His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme Court. \n\nWilliam H. Ginsburg (March 25, 1943\u00a0\u2013 April 1, 2013) was an American lawyer, best known for representing former White House intern Monica Lewinsky in her controversy regarding sexual activities with President Bill Clinton in 1998. \n\n",

        "context": "Donald Trump in music refers to songs, albums and bands that refer to Donald Trump and his various brands, including Trump Tower, his TV show, his hotel chain, and his casinos.  Though recent songs refer to Trump's campaign and subsequent election as president of the United States, more than 200 songs refer to Trump prior to his successful presidential campaign between 1989 and 2013.  With his victory in the 2016 presidential election, Trump's prominence in hip-hop music has been liked to that of Ronald Reagan's in hardcore punk during the 1980s. \n\nProtests against Donald Trump, or anti-Trump protests, have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere since Donald Trump's entry into the 2016 presidential campaign.  Protests have expressed opposition to Trump's campaign rhetoric, his electoral win, his inauguration and various presidential actions.  Some protests have taken the form of walk-outs, business closures, petitions and, especially since Trump's inauguration, rallies, demonstrations or marches.  While most protests have been peaceful, some protesters have destroyed property, and attacked Trump supporters. \n\nAnthony Fabrizio (born 1960) is an American Republican pollster and strategist.  He is the principal in Fabrizio, Lee & Associates, and was the pollster for Donald Trump's fall 2016 Presidential campaign, former Senator Bob Dole's 1996 Presidential campaign, U.S. Senator Rand Paul's U.S. Senate and 2016 Presidential campaign, and former Governor Rick Perry's 2012 Presidential campaign, among others.  He also served as a pollster for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in the 2014 midterm elections. \n\nDavid Urban (born c. 1964) is an American lobbyist, political operative, and political commentator who worked on the 2016 Donald Trump presidential campaign, helping to orchestrate the 2016 Republican National Convention and serving as a senior advisor in the successful effort to win Pennsylvania.  In November 2016, it was reported that Urban was being considered as the next chair of the Republican National Committee, as well as the White House Deputy Chief of Staff, and in May 2017, it was reported that Trump was considering Urban to replace Reince Priebus as White House Chief of Staff. \n\nPaul John Manafort Jr. (born April 1, 1949) is an American lawyer, lobbyist and political consultant.  He joined Donald Trump's presidential campaign team in March 2016 and served as campaign manager from June to August 2016.  He was previously an adviser to the U.S. presidential campaigns of Republicans Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bob Dole.  In 1980 Manafort co-founded the Washington, D.C.-based lobbying firm Black, Manafort & Stone, along with principals Charles R. Black Jr., and Roger J. Stone.  In 1984 it was renamed Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly (BMSK) & associates, after Peter G. Kelly was recruited. \n\nIllegal immigration was a signature issue of U.S. President Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and his proposed reforms and remarks about this issue generated much publicity.  A hallmark promise of his campaign was to build a substantial wall on the United States-Mexico border.  Trump has also expressed support for a variety of \"limits on legal immigration and guest-worker visas\", including a \"pause\" on granting green cards, which Trump says will \"allow record immigration levels to subside to more moderate historical averages\".  Trump's proposals regarding H-1B visas frequently changed throughout his presidential campaign, but as of late July 2016, he appeared to oppose the H-1B visa program.  Trump has questioned official estimates of the number of illegal immigrants in the United States (between 11 and 12 million), insisting the number is much higher (between 30 and 34 million). \n\nHope Charlotte Hicks (born October 21, 1988) is an American communications and public relations consultant who is the current White House Communications Director for President Donald Trump.  From January to September 2017, she served as White House Director of Strategic Communications, a role created for her.  She previously served as the press secretary and early communications director for Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, as well as the national press secretary for his presidential transition team, and before that was an employee of The Trump Organization.  She is Trump's longest-serving political aide. \n\nBrad Parscale (born January 3, 1976) is an American digital media and political strategist.  He served as the digital media director for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.  Parscale began working for the Trump Organization in 2011, developing and designing websites, and creating and managing digital media strategies.  In early 2015, Trump hired Parscale and his firm, Giles-Parscale, to create a website for his exploratory campaign.  When Trump declared himself a Republican candidate in 2015, one of the first people he called was Parscale, asking him to update his exploratory campaign site into a \"full-fledged presidential campaign website.\"  Throughout the Republican primary, Parscale was responsible for the Donald J. Trump for President website, as well as for digital media strategy and online fundraising campaigns.  In June 2016, Parscale was officially named digital media director for the Donald J. Trump for President campaign, overseeing all aspects of digital media and online fundraising, as well as traditional media strategy, like radio and television placements.  In January 2017, Parscale, along with another senior Trump aide, Nick Ayers, formally launched America First Policies, a non-profit organization that promotes President Trump's agenda and White House initiatives. \n\nDonald Trump's presidential campaign of 2000 for the nomination of the Reform Party began when real estate magnate Donald Trump of New York announced the creation of a presidential exploratory committee on the October 7, 1999 edition of \"Larry King Live\".  Though Trump had never held elected office, he was well known for his frequent comments on public affairs and business exploits as head of The Trump Organization.  He had previously considered a presidential run in 1988 as a Republican, but chose not to run.  For 2000, Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura persuaded Trump to seek the presidential nomination of the Reform Party, which was fracturing despite achieving ballot access and qualifying for matching funds as a result of the 1996 presidential campaign of businessman Ross Perot.  Trump's entrance into the Reform Party race coincided with that of paleoconservative commentator Pat Buchanan, whom Trump attacked throughout the campaign as a \"Hitler-lover.\" \n\n\"Donald Trump\" is a segment of the HBO news satire television series \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" devoted to Donald Trump, who later became the President of the United States.  It first aired on February 28, 2016, as part of the third episode of \"Last Week Tonight\"'s third season, when Trump was the frontrunner for the Republican Party nomination for the presidency.  During the 22-minute segment, comedian John Oliver discusses Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and his career in business, outlining his campaign rhetoric, varying political positions and failed business ventures.  He also says the Trump family name was changed at one point from the ancestral name \"Drumpf\". \n\n",

Hubbard incorporates historical background from the Blackfeet tribe into the book. \n\nThe Birds on the Trees is a novel by Nina Bawden first published in 1970 about a middle-class English family whose 19-year-old son does not live up to his parents' expectations. \n\nThree Comrades (German: \"Drei Kameraden\" ) is a novel first published in 1936 by the German author Erich Maria Remarque.  It is written in first person by the main character Robert Lohkamp, whose somewhat disillusioned outlook on life is due to his horrifying experiences in the trenches of the First World War's French-German front.  He shares these experiences with Otto K\u00f6ster and Gottfried Lenz, his two comrades with whom he runs an auto-repair shop in late 1920s Berlin (probably).  Remarque wrote the novel in exile and it was first published in Dutch translation as \"Drie kameraden\", with English translation following soon in \"Good Housekeeping\" from January to March 1937 and in the book form in the same year.  First German language edition was published in 1938 by exile publisher \"Querido\" in Amsterdam, but the novel was published in Germany only in 1951. \n\nThe Golden Hour is a children's novel by Maiya Williams.  It was first published in 2004 and is the first of the Golden Hour time travel series.  It tells the story of Rowan Popplewell and his sister, Nina, who, while emotionally disturbed by the death of their mother, travel back in time to the French Revolution. \n\nSpirit of the Border is an historical novel written by Zane Grey, first published in 1906.  The novel is based on events occurring in the Ohio River Valley in the late eighteenth century.  It features the exploits of Lewis Wetzel, a historical personage who had dedicated his life to the destruction of Native Americans and to the protection of nascent white settlements in that region.  The story deals with the attempt by Moravian Church missionaries to Christianize Indians and how two brothers' lives take different paths upon their arrival on the border.  A highly romanticized account, the novel is the second in a trilogy, the first of which is \"Betty Zane\", Grey's first published work, and \"The Last Trail\", which focuses on the life of Jonathan Zane, Grey's ancestor. \n\n",

Screenings take place at Yale University\u2019s Whitney Humanities Center Auditorium and the New Haven Free Public Library.  NHdocs is a regional festival that showcases documentaries by filmmakers from the greater New Haven area and beyond.  NHdocs was launched in 2014 when the film festival\u2019s co-founders Charles Musser, Gorman Bechard, Jacob Bricca, and Lisa Molomot came together at the Big Sky Documentary Film Festival and decided to create a documentary film festival in New Haven that would \u201cbuild a sense of community among documentary filmmakers from the greater New Haven area.\u201d  In 2014, the four filmmakers each showed one of their recently completed documentaries, three of which had just played at the Big Sky. \n\nThomas Gordon (c. 1691\u20131750) was a Scottish writer and Commonwealthman.  Along with John Trenchard, he published \"The Independent Whig\", which was a weekly periodical.  From 1720 to 1723, Trenchard and Gordon wrote a series of 144 essays entitled \"Cato's Letters\", condemning corruption and lack of morality within the British political system and warning against tyranny.  The essays were published as \"Essays on Liberty, Civil and Religious\", at first in the \"London Journal\" and then in the \"British Journal\".  These essays became a cornerstone of the Commonwealth man tradition and were influential in shaping the ideas of the Country Party.  His ideas played an important role in shaping republicanism in Britain and especially in the American colonies leading up to the American revolution.  Zuckert argues, \"The writers who, more than any others, put together the new synthesis that is the new republicanism were John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, writing in the early eighteenth century as \"Cato.\" \n\nThe International Documentary Film Festival Docville is an annual documentary film festival set in Leuven, Belgium. \n\nChagrin Documentary Film Festival is an annual documentary film festival based in Chagrin Falls, Ohio.

He was given the title People's Artist of the RSFSR in 1969.  He was intimately involved in development of the style of film making known as Soviet montage, especially it's psychological underpinning, including the use of editing and the cut to emotionally influence the audience, a principle known as the Kuleshov effect.  He also developed the theory of creative geography, which is the use of the action around a cut to connect otherwise disparate settings into a cohesive narrative. \n\nAnani ben Sason (also called 'Anani, 'Inani, and 'Inyani) was a Jewish Talmudist who lived in the Land of Israel, known as an amora of the third century, a contemporary of R. Ammi.  He rarely discussed \"Halakot\", and his discussions of them were not original (\"Shab. \" 64b).  Once he recited a \"Halakah\" in the patriarch's mansion, without naming its author, which provoked R. Ammi to ask: \"Is it his own?  It is what R. Eleazar had reported in the name of R. Oshaiah\" (M. \u1e32.  24b).  In the \"Haggadah\", he sometimes reported the sayings of others, but more often he was original.  Thus, as a reason for the juxtaposition of the regulations regarding the sacrificial rites and the priestly vestments (\"Ex. \" xxviii-xxix), he points out that the priestly vestments were to have atoning effects as well as the sacrifices.  He represents the miter as atoning for haughtiness, and cites R. Chanina as saying, \"That which rests highest on the priest atones for one's considering himself high\"; and similarly with the rest of the priestly garments (\"Zeb.\"  88b; \" 'Ar.\"  16a; compare \"Yer.  Yoma,\" vii.  44b; \"Lev.  R.\" x.).  Referring to God's appearance in the thorn-bush (\"Ex.\"  iii.  2-4) he remarks, \"The Holy One\u2014blessed be He! \u2014said to Moses, 'When I will it, one of my angels stretcheth forth his hand from heaven and reacheth to the ground,' as the Scripture says [\"Ezek. \" viii.  3], 'He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of mine head'; and when it so pleaseth me, I make three angels sit under one tree [\"Gen.\" xviii.  4]; when I choose, my glory fills the universe, as it is written [\"Jer.\"  xxiii.  24], 'Do I not fill heaven and earth?  saith the Lord'; 'and when I so willed, I spoke to Job in a whirlwind, as it is said [\"Job,\" xxxviii.  1, xl.  6], \"The Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind\"\" (\"Ex.  R.\" iii., where the interpretation is somewhat forced). \n\nAryanto Yuniawan (born June 18, 1977 in Magelang; age 40) is Chief Executive Officer of PT Mataram Surya Visi Sinema, a multimedia and animation movie company located in Jogja Indonesia.

Of his personal history nothing is known, except that he had seen the Temple at Jerusalem and was familiar with the specific purposes of its many apartments, a subject on which he was considered an authority (Yoma 16b).  Some of the details, however, he eventually forgot, and was reminded of them by Abba Saul b. Ba\u1e6dnit (Mid.  ii.  5, v. 4).  Simon b. 'Azzai, R. Akiva's contemporary, relates that he had discovered a genealogical roll wherein was stated, \"The Mishnah of R. Eliezer b.

        "context": "The Muscogee language (Mvskoke in Muscogee), also known as Creek, Seminole, Mask\u00f3k\u00ee or Muskogee, is a Muskogean language spoken by Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole people, primarily in the U.S. states of Oklahoma and Florida. \n\nBlack Indians are people of mixed African-American and Native American heritage, who have strong ties to Native American culture.  Many Indigenous peoples of the Eastern Woodlands, such as the Narragansett, Pequot, Lumbee and Cherokee, have a significant degree of African ancestry. \n\nThe Seminole are a Native American people originally from Florida.  Today, they principally live in Oklahoma with a minority in Florida, and comprise three federally recognized tribes: the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, as well as independent groups.  The Seminole nation emerged in a process of ethnogenesis from various Native American groups who settled in Florida in the 18th century, most significantly northern Muscogee (Creeks) from what is now Georgia and Alabama.  The word \"Seminole\" is derived from the Creek word \"siman\u00f3-li\", which may be itself be derived from the Spanish word \"cimarr\u00f3n\", menaning \"runaway\" or \"wild one\". \n\nThe history of draining and development of the Everglades dates back to the 19th century.  During the Second Seminole War beginning in 1836, the United States military's mission was to seek out Seminole people in the Everglades and capture or kill them.  Those missions gave the military the opportunity to map land that seemed to frustrate and confound them at every turn.  A national push for expansion and progress toward the latter part of the 19th century stimulated interest in draining the Everglades for agricultural use.  According to historians, \"From the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century, the United States went through a period in which wetland removal was not questioned.  Indeed, it was considered the proper thing to do.\" \n\nSeminole music is the music of the Seminole people, an indigenous people of the Americas who formed in Florida in the 18th century.  Today most live in Oklahoma, but a minority continue in Florida.  They have three federally recognized tribes, and some people belong to bands outside those groups.  Their traditional music includes extensive use of rattles, hand drums, water drums, and flutes. \n\nSeminole County is a county located in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 25,482.  Its county seat is Wewoka.  Before Oklahoma's admission as a state, the county was the entire small portion of Indian Territory allocated to the Seminole people, who were removed from Florida in the 1820s. \n\nThe Battle of Jupiter Inlet occurred on January 15, 1838, between the Seminole Indians - Seminole Negro and the United States Navy.  This was the first of a series of battles led by the US Navy in the area, also referred to as the First Battle of Loxahatchee.  The battle started when Lt. Levin Powell led an expedition of 200 soldiers, sailors and marines, down the east coast of Florida.  The Navy spotted a trail alongside the Jupiter Inlet, and seventy-five men were landed to find the Seminole camp nearby.  The camp was led by Sam Jones, Ar-pi-uck-i, the spiritual medicine and war chief of the Miccosukee and Seminole people during the war.  The officers that advanced on the camp were outnumbered and ambushed.  After a long fight, the US retreated with five men killed in action and about twenty others wounded.  Ltn.  Powell was one of those killed in battle. \n\nThe Seminole Nation of Oklahoma is a federally recognized Native American tribe based in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.  It is the largest of the three federally recognized Seminole governments, which include the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida.  Its members are descendants of the 3,000 Seminoles who were forcibly removed from Florida to Indian Territory, along with 800 Black Seminoles, after the Second Seminole War.  The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma is headquartered in Wewoka within Seminole County, Oklahoma.  Of 18,800 enrolled tribal members, 13,533 live within the state of Oklahoma.  The tribe began to revive its government in 1936 under the Indian Reorganization Act.  While its reservation was originally larger, today the tribal jurisdictional area covers Seminole County, Oklahoma, within which it has a variety of properties. \n\nDhoolpet is one of the old suburbs in Hyderabad, India.  It is part of the old city of Hyderabad.  This place is inhabited by people who migrated from Uttar Pradesh during the Nizam rule.  The Nizam helped these people settle in this area.  The area is notorious for bootlegging and has witnessed attacks on policemen or excise department officials during raids. \n\nThe Black Seminoles are black Indians associated with the Seminole people in Florida and Oklahoma.  They are the descendants of free blacks and of escaped slaves (called maroons) who allied with Seminole groups in Spanish Florida.  Historically, the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole.  Some were held as slaves of particular Seminole leaders; but they had more freedom than did slaves held by whites in the South and by other Native American tribes, including the right to bear arms. \n\n",

        "context": "Keyed Up is the fifteenth studio album by country music star Ronnie Milsap, released in 1983.  It featured the No.\u00a05 country chart hit \"Stranger in My House\", plus the No.\u00a01 country hits \"Don't You Know How Much I Love You\" and \"Show Her.\" \n\nCountry Music Star No. 1 contains recordings of a prestardom Glen Campbell, which were made around 1960\u20131961.  This album, just like the other Starday album Country Soul, was released after Campbell rose to international fame with hits including \"Gentle on My Mind\", \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" and \"Wichita Lineman\".  Campbell sued against these releases but eventually settled with Starday. \n\n\"Stranger in the House\" is a song composed by Elvis Costello.  Costello recorded the song as a duet with country music star George Jones in the summer of 1978 for Jones' 1979 album \"My Very Special Guests\".  Costello also recorded a solo version recorded at a John Peel session on October 1978 which surfaced as a free 7\" single with the first copies of his second album \"This Year's Model\" in the United Kingdom.  According to Holly Jones-Warren's liner notes to the 2005 Legacy Records reissue of \"My Very Special Guests\", Costello wrote the song specifically with Jones in mind, with the new wave star stating, \"George Jones was my guiding light whenever I wrote in the country idiom.\" \n\nGruhn Guitars is a musical instrument shop and place of interest located in Nashville, Tennessee.  Vintage instruments comprise a large portion of its inventory, but it also features new instruments from factories and independent luthiers.  It is a mecca for rock stars and well-heeled collectors.  The business opened on January 2, 1970.  It won a lot of new business and national attention after Visa featured it in 1992 in a TV commercial.  George Gruhn is the world\u2019s leading expert on vintage American guitars and related instruments, according to Walter Carter, historian and archivist for the Gibson Guitar Company.  The shop was originally called GTR, which stood for George Gruhn, Tut Taylor and Randy Wood; a story has circulated that country music star Hank Williams, Jr. encouraged Gruhn to go into business.  The store is located right by the stage door of the Ryman Auditorium, the home of the Grand Ole Opry.  On December 31, 2006, Garrison Keillor, for his New Year's Show at Ryman Auditorium for PBS' \"Great Performances\" visited Gruhn Guitars with Vince Gill before the start of the show.  Garrison Keiller's New Year's Eve Special Gill told a story about buying some of his guitars at Gruhn's.  \"Gruhn's customer's have included the likes of Duane Allman, Mark Knopfler, Conan O'Brien, Robert Plant and Eric Clapton. \n\nRandy Bruce Traywick (born May 4, 1959), better known by his stage name, Randy Travis, is an American country music singer, songwriter, guitarist, and actor.  Since 1985, he has recorded 20 studio albums and charted more than 50 singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs charts, and 16 of these were number-one hits.  Considered a pivotal figure in the history of country music, Travis broke through in the mid-1980s with the release of his album \"Storms of Life\", which sold more than four million copies.  The album established him as a major force in the Neotraditional country movement.  Travis followed up his successful debut with a string of platinum and multi-platinum albums.  He is known for his distinctive baritone vocals, delivered in a traditional style that has made him a country music star since the 1980s. \n\nChristy Sutherland (born April 9, 1976) is a Nashville country music and praise/worship singer-songwriter.  Signed to Epic Records in 2004, she charted the single \"Freedom\" on the Hot Country Songs charts.  She is married to Kenneth Matthew Dudney, son of Country music star, Barbara Mandrell.  The two were wed on July 14, 2006 during a private ceremony at Mandrell's private home.  Dudney currently works as tour and business manager for Sutherland. \n\nThis Is Me is the ninth studio album by country music star Randy Travis, and was released on April 26, 1994 by Warner Bros..  Producer Kyle Lehning, Travis, and A&R Martha Sharp considered more than 1,000 songs before settling on the final ten.  The tracks \"Before You Kill Us All\", \"Whisper My Name\", \"This Is Me\", and \"The Box\" were all released as singles, peaking at #2, #1, #5, and #8, respectively, on the \"Billboard\" country music charts.  \"Small Y'all\" was later recorded by George Jones on his 1998 album \"It Don't Get Any Better Than This\". \n\nBased on a True Story\u2026 is the eighth studio album by American country music artist Blake Shelton.  It was released on March 26, 2013 via Warner Bros.  Records and debuted at #3 with a career best for Shelton at nearly 200,000 sold.  The album became the ninth best-selling album of 2013 in the US, earning Shelton a Platinum certification by the RIAA on September 30, 2013.  In 2016, \"Based on a True Story\u2026\" was certified double-platinum by the RIAA. \n\nOld 8\u00d710 is the third studio album by country music star Randy Travis.  It was released on July 12, 1988 by Warner Bros.  Records Nashville.  The album produced the singles \"Honky Tonk Moon\", \"Deeper Than the Holler\", \"Is It Still Over\", and \"Promises\".  All of these except \"Promises\" reached Number One on the Hot Country Songs charts in the late 1980s.  The German edition of the album (the first Randy Travis release in that country) contained the bonus track \"Forever and Ever, Amen\".  In January 1990, Old 8\u00d710 earned Travis three American Music Awards for 'Favorite Country Male Artist', 'Favorite Country Album', and 'Favorite Country Single' (Deeper Than the Holler). \n\n\"My Eyes\" is a song recorded by American country music artist Blake Shelton featuring Gwen Sebastian.  It was released in April 2014 as the fifth single from his seventh studio album, \"Based on a True Story...\".  The song was written by Andrew Dorff, Tommy Lee James and Josh Osborne. \n\n",

        "context": "In Norse mythology, Andlang (also Andl\u00e0ngr or \u00d6ndlangr) is described as the second heavenly realm which stretches between the first, containing the halls of the gods, and the third, named V\u00eddbl\u00e1in.  In all there are nine heavens according to Snorri.  Andlang will serve as a shelter and dwelling place for the souls of the dead during and after the destruction of Ragnar\u00f6k. \n\nTakama-ga-hara (\u9ad8\u5929\u539f , the Plain of High Heaven ) is a place in Japanese mythology.  In Shinto, Takama-ga-hara (or Takama no Hara) is the dwelling place of the kami.  It is believed to be connected to the Earth by the bridge \"Ama-no uki-hashi\" (the \"Floating Bridge of Heaven\"). \n\nThe designation oldest synagogue in the United Kingdom requires careful definition.  A number of synagogues that predate the expulsion of the Jews from England have been discovered by archaeologists or by historians in buildings that have been in use for other purposes for many centuries.  A second set of synagogues post-dates the legal return of Jews to England in the seventeenth century.  Some synagogues have been destroyed or demolished and rebuilt on the same site, so that, while the site or congregation may be very old, the building may be modern.  Still other old synagogue buildings exist, but were sold by the congregation and are now used for other purposes, some as churches or mosques, others for everything from residences to school recital halls.  And some very old synagogues have been in continuous use as synagogues for many centuries. \n\nCh\u00e2teau de Druyes is a medieval castle located in Druyes-les-Belles-Fontaines in Yonne,\u00a0 Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9.  It was built in the 12th century by the Counts of Nevers, and remained in their possession until the 18th century.  It was as much a noble residence as it was a fortified castle.  It was a frequented dwelling place of Peter II of Courtenay, the Emperor of Constantinople in the 13th century, and his daughter Matilda, Countess of Nevers, Auxerre and Tonnerre. \n\nIn Norse mythology, V\u00ed\u00f0bl\u00e1inn is the third heaven in the cosmology of Snorri's \"Gylfaginning\", located above Andlang and Asgard.  It will serve as a shelter and dwelling place for the souls of the dead during and after the destruction of Ragnar\u00f6k. \n\nIn zoology, an inquiline (from Latin \"inquilinus\", \"lodger\" or \"tenant\") is an animal that lives commensally in the nest, burrow, or dwelling place of an animal of another species.  For example, some organisms such as insects may live in the homes of gophers and feed on debris, fungi, roots, etc.  The most widely distributed types of inquiline are those found in association with the nests of social insects, especially ants and termites\u00a0\u2013 a single colony may support dozens of different inquiline species.  The distinctions between parasites, social parasites, and inquilines are subtle, and many species may fulfill the criteria for more than one of these, as inquilines do exhibit many of the same characteristics as parasites.  However, parasites are specifically \"not\" inquilines, because by definition they have a deleterious effect on the host species, while inquilines do not. \n\nShamayim (\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05de\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd), the Hebrew word for \"heaven\" (literally \"heavens\", plural), denotes one component of the three-part cosmos, the other elements being \"erets\" (the earth) and \"sheol\" (the underworld).  \"Shamayim\" is the dwelling place of God and other heavenly beings, \"erets\" is the home of the living, and \"sheol\" is the realm of the dead, including, in post-Hebrew Bible literature (including the Christian New Testament), the abode of the righteous dead. \n\nThe designation oldest synagogue in the world requires careful definition.  Many very old synagogues have been discovered in archaeological digs.  Some synagogues have been destroyed and rebuilt several times on the same site, so, while the site or congregation may be ancient, the building may be modern.  Still other very old synagogue buildings exist, but have been used for many centuries as churches, mosques, or for other purposes.  And some very old synagogues have been in continuous use as synagogues for many centuries. \n\nFlaming Feather is a 1952 Technicolor Western film directed by Ray Enright and starring Sterling Hayden.  The film was shot on location around Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ, and at the Montezuma Castle National Monument near Sedona.  The local Yavapai Indians, who were employed as extras on the production, refused to enter the cliff-dwellings because they represented the \"dwelling place of the dead.\"  Consequently, production was delayed while a band of Navajos was brought in from a reservation 137 miles away to replace them. \n\nThe Tabernacle (Hebrew: \u05de\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05db\u05b7\u05bc\u05df\u200e \u200e , \"mishkan\", \"residence\" or \"dwelling place\"), according to the Hebrew Bible, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God amongst the children of Israel from the time of the Exodus from Egypt through the conquering of the land of Canaan.  Built of woven layers of curtains along with 48 boards clad with polished gold standing like vertical blinds held in place by 5 bars per side with the middle bar shooting through from end to end and furnished with items made from the gold, silver, brass, furs, jewels, and other valuable materials taken out of Egypt at God's orders, and according to specifications revealed by Yahweh (God) to Moses at Mount Sinai, it was transported by the Israelites on their journey through the wilderness and their conquest of the Promised Land.  Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem superseded it as the dwelling-place of God some 300 years later. \n\n",

        "context": "Christopher Mitchell (21 May 1947\u00a0\u2013 22 February 2001) was a British actor most notable for his role in the BBC sitcom \"It Ain't Half Hot Mum\" as Gunner Nigel 'Parky' Parkin.  His film credits include \"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\" (1967), \"This, That and the Other\" (1969), \"The Sex Thief\" (1973) and \"What's Up Superdoc! \" (1978). \n\nRoy Holder (born 15 June 1946) is an English television actor who has appeared in various programmes including \"Ace of Wands\", \"Z-Cars\", \"Spearhead\", the \"Doctor Who\" serial \"The Caves of Androzani\" and \"Sorry! \" His first notable appearance on the screen was in the 1961 film \"Whistle Down the Wind\", and he then appeared in \"The Taming of the Shrew\" (1967), \"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\" (1967), \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1968), \"The Virgin Soldiers\" (1969), \"Loot\" (1970), \"Psychomania\" (1973), \"The Land That Time Forgot\" (1975), \"Trial by Combat\" (1976) and \"Jesus of Nazareth\" (1977).  More recently, Roy played the part of Mr Hill in \"Pride & Prejudice\" (2005), and Gaffer Tom in \"Robin Hood\" (2010). \n\n\"The Wheels on the Bus\" is an American folk song dating no later than 1939 written by Verna Hills.  It is a popular children's song in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and Canada, and is often sung by children on bus trips to keep themselves amused.  It has a very repetitive rhythm, making the song easy for a large number of people to sing, in a manner similar to the song \"99 Bottles of Beer\".  It is based on fellow traditional British song \"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\".  The song is also sometimes sung to the tune of \"Buffalo Gals\", as in the version done by Raffi. \n\nClive Stanley Donner (21 January 1926 \u2013 6 September 2010) was a British film director who was a defining part of the British New Wave, directing films such as \"The Caretaker\", \"Nothing But the Best\", \"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\" and \"What's New Pussycat? \".  He also directed television movies and commercials through the mid-1990s. \n\n\"Michael Finnegan\" (variant spellings include \"Michael Finnagen\" and \"Michael Vinnegan\") is an example of an unboundedly long song, which can continue with numerous variations until the singer decides (or is forced) to stop.  Like most other perpetual songs, this song tends to be sung by schoolchildren.  It is a popular song often sung around a campfire or during scouting events.  The origin of the words and music is unknown, but the tune bears similarity to Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush.  The earliest documented reference is \"The Hackney Scout Song Book\" (Stacy & Son Ltd, 1921).  It also appears in \"The Oxford song book, vol.2, collected and arranged by Thomas Wood\" (Oxford University Press, 1927). \n\nHere We Go Round the Mulberry Bush is a 1967 British film made based on the novel of the same name by Hunter Davies.  It was listed to compete at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival, but the festival was cancelled due to the events of May 1968 in France. \n\nHere We Go Round the Mulberry Bush (disambiguation) \n\n\"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\" is a single by Traffic.  It is the title song to the film \"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\", and features all four members of Traffic singing a joint lead, though the bridge and parts of the chorus have Steve Winwood singing unaccompanied.  The single uses an edited version of the song, with the intro removed.  When released in late 1967, the single cracked the UK Top 10.  Footage of the band acting out the song was commissioned by The Beatles for possible inclusion in the film \"Magical Mystery Tour\" but was not used in the final edit.  It is now included in the special features of the 2012 DVD/Blu-ray edition of the film. \n\nTraffic were an English rock band, formed in Birmingham.  The group was formed in April 1967 by Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, Chris Wood and Dave Mason.  They began as a psychedelic rock group and diversified their sound through the use of instruments such as keyboards like the Mellotron and harpsichord, sitar, and various reed instruments, and by incorporating jazz and improvisational techniques in their music.  Their first three singles were \"Paper Sun\", \"Hole in My Shoe\", and \"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\". \n\n\"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\" (also titled \"Mulberry Bush\" or \"This is the Way\") is an English language nursery rhyme and singing game.  It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 7882.  The same tune is also used for \"Lazy Mary, Will You Get Up\" and a variant is used for The Wheels on the Bus. \n\n",

The behavior of the conductivity near this percolation threshold will show a smooth change over from the conductivity of the dielectric component to the conductivity of the metallic component and can be described using two critical exponents s and t, whereas the dielectric constant will diverge if the threshold is approached from either side.  To include the frequency dependent behavior, a resistor-capacitor model (R-C model) is used. \n\n1-Pentanol, (or n-pentanol, pentan-1-ol), is an alcohol with five carbon atoms and the molecular formula CHOH.  1-Pentanol is a colorless liquid with an unpleasant aroma.  It is the straight-chain form of amyl alcohol, one of 8 isomers with that formula. \n\nAn aldonic acid is any of a family of sugar acids obtained by oxidation of the aldehyde functional group of an aldose to form a carboxylic acid functional group.  Thus, their general chemical formula is HOOC-(CHOH)-CHOH.  Oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl group instead of the terminal aldehyde yields a uronic acid, while oxidation of both terminal ends yields an aldaric acid. \n\nIsopropyl alcohol (IUPAC name propan-2-ol), also called dimethyl carbinol or, incorrectly, isopropanol, is a compound with the chemical formula CHO or CHOH or CHCHOHCH (sometimes represented as \"i\"-PrOH).  It is a colorless, flammable chemical compound with a strong odor.  As a propyl group linked to a hydroxyl group, it is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol, where the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms, sometimes shown as (CH)CHOH.  It is a structural isomer of 1-propanol.  It has a wide variety of industrial and household uses, and is a common ingredient in chemicals such as antiseptics, disinfectants and detergents. \n\n1-Hexanol is an organic alcohol with a six-carbon chain and a condensed structural formula of CH(CH)OH.  This colorless liquid is slightly soluble in water, but miscible with diethyl ether and ethanol.  Two additional straight chain isomers of 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol and 3-hexanol, exist, both of which differing by the location of the hydroxyl group.  Many isomeric alcohols have the formula CHOH.  It is used in the perfume industry. \n\nTetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride (THPC) is an organophosphorus compound with the chemical formula [P(CHOH)]Cl.  The cation P(CHOH) is four-coordinate, as is typical for phosphonium salts. THPC has applications as a precursor to fire-retardant materials. \n\nSeidel's algorithm is an algorithm designed by Raimund Seidel in 1992 for the all-pairs-shortest-path problem for undirected, unweighted, connected graphs.  It solves the problem in formula_1 expected time for a graph with formula_2 vertices, where formula_3 is the exponent in the complexity formula_4 of formula_5 matrix multiplication.  If only the distances between each pair of vertices are sought, the same time bound can be achieved in the worst case.  Note that even though the algorithm is designed for connected graphs, it can be applied individually to each connected component of a graph with the same running time overall.  Note also that there is an exception to the expected running time given above for computing the paths: if formula_6 the expected running time becomes formula_7. \n\nAlcohol is any organic compound in which a hydroxyl functional group (-OH) is bound to a carbon atom, usually connected to other carbon or hydrogen atoms.  An important class are the simple acyclic alcohols, the general formula for which is CHOH.  Of those, ethanol (CHOH) is the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, and in common speech the word alcohol refers specifically to ethanol.  Articles related to alcohol include: \n\nXylitol is a sugar alcohol used as a sweetener.  The name derives from Greek: \u03be\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd , \"xyl[on]\", \"wood\" + suffix -\"itol\", used to denote sugar alcohols.  Xylitol is categorized as a polyalcohol or sugar alcohol (alditol).  It has the formula CHOH(CHOH)CHOH and is an achiral isomer of pentane-1,2,3,4,5-pentol.  Multiple studies using electron microscopy have indicated that xylitol is effective in inducing remineralization of deeper layers of demineralized enamel.  Fair evidence was found that xylitol (as chewing gum, lozenges, nasal spray, etc.) reduced the incidence of acute middle ear infection in healthy children. \n\nGluconic acid is an organic compound with molecular formula CHO and condensed structural formula HOCH(CHOH)COOH.  It is one of the 16 stereoisomers of 2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxyhexanoic acid. \n\n",

Mark Fry, long-time pro at Sequoyah Country Club in Oakland, California, holds the record for most victories with 10.  Tony Lema, British Open winner in 1964 and 12-time PGA Tour winner, won three consecutive Northern California PGA championships from 1962\u201364.  Other PGA Tour winners who were also victorious in the Northern California PGA Championship include Bob Lunn (six-time PGA tour winner), Dick Lotz (three-time PGA tour winner), Bruce Summerhays (three-time PGA tour winner, Bob Wynn, and John McMullin. \n\nThe 1977 PGA Championship was the 59th PGA Championship, played August 11\u201314 at Pebble Beach Golf Links in Pebble Beach, California.  Lanny Wadkins, 27, won his only major championship in a sudden-death playoff over Gene Littler.  It was the first playoff at the PGA Championship in ten years and was the first-ever sudden-death playoff in a stroke-play major championship.  The last was 36 years earlier at the 1941 PGA Championship, when the 36-hole final match went to two extra holes. \n\nThe Middle Atlantic PGA Championship is a golf tournament that is the championship of the Middle Atlantic section of the PGA of America.  The tournament has been played annually since 1932 in Virginia, Maryland, or Washington, DC.  Fred Funk, eight-time winner on the PGA Tour, holds the record with six Middle Atlantic PGA victories.  Other PGA Tour winners who have also won the Middle Atlantic PGA Championship include Chandler Harper (seven time PGA tour winner and 1950 PGA Championship winner), Bobby Cruickshank (17-time PGA tour winner), Lew Worsham (four-time PGA tour winner), and George Fazio (two-time PGA tour winner and golf course designer). \n\nThe Connecticut PGA Championship is a golf tournament that is a championship of the Connecticut section of the PGA of America.  The tournament has been played annually since 1929 mostly in Connecticut, although it's been held four times in Massachusetts.  Dennis Coscina, who has competed on the Senior tour and is long-time teaching pro, holds the record for most wins with eight.  PGA Tour winners who have also won the Connecticut PGA Championship include Gene Kunes and Joe Turnesa.  The winner of the Connecticut PGA Championship earns entry into the Travelers Championship. \n\nThe 2000 PGA Championship was the 82nd PGA Championship, held August 17\u201320 at the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky.  It was the second time for the event at Valhalla, which hosted four years earlier in 1996.  Tiger Woods won his second straight PGA Championship and fifth major in a three-hole playoff over Bob May.  Woods and May finished at 18 under par to set the PGA Championship record to par, later equaled by Woods in 2006.  It was the first time since 1937 that a PGA Championship title was successfully defended, and the first ever as a stroke play event.  Woods and May were five shots ahead of third-place finisher Thomas Bj\u00f8rn. \n\nThe 1940 PGA Championship was the 23rd PGA Championship, held August 26 to September 2 at Hershey Country Club in Hershey, Pennsylvania, east of Harrisburg.  Then a match play championship, Byron Nelson won his first PGA Championship, defeating Sam Snead 1 up in the 36-hole final.  It was the third of Nelson's five major titles; he won the PGA Championship again in 1945.  From 1939 to 1945, Nelson made five of the six finals, missing only in 1942 (not held in 1943). \n\nThe Argentine PGA Championship is a golf tournament played in Argentina since 1920.  It was generally supported by the leading Argentine golfers and its list of champions includes Eduardo Romero (8 times), Jos\u00e9 Jurado (7 times), Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez (5 times), Jos\u00e9 C\u00f3ceres (twice) and \u00c1ngel Cabrera.  However, the record holder is former British Open champion Roberto De Vicenzo, who recorded 16 victories between 1944 and 1985. \n\nThe 2006 PGA Championship was the 88th PGA Championship, played August 17\u201320 at Medinah Country Club in Medinah, Illinois, a suburb northwest of Chicago.  Tiger Woods won his third PGA Championship, five shots ahead of runner-up Shaun Micheel, the 2003 champion.  Woods' victory was his 12th major championship.  The No. 3 Course was the longest to date in major championship history.  Medinah previously hosted the tournament in 1999, when Woods captured his first PGA Championship.  The purse was $6.8 million with a winner's share of $1.224 million. \n\nThe 1939 PGA Championship was the 22nd PGA Championship, held July 9\u201315 at Pomonok Country Club in Queens, New York.  Then a match play championship, Henry Picard won his only PGA Championship, defeating Byron Nelson with a birdie at the 37th hole.  It was the second of his two major titles; he won the Masters in 1938.  Nelson won the U.S. Open three months earlier and the next PGA Championship in 1940.  Beginning in 1939, he made five finals in six PGA Championships, and won his second title in 1945. \n\nThe 2018 PGA Championship is the forthcoming 100th PGA Championship that will take place from August 9\u201312 at Bellerive Country Club in Town and Country, Missouri.  This will be the second PGA Championship at Bellerive.  This will also be the last PGA Championship to be held in the month of August; just before the 2017 tournament, the PGA announced that the Championship would be held in May beginning in 2019. \n\n",

        "context": "The Vice President of Panama is the second-highest political position in the Government of Panama.  Since 2009, the position of Vice President has been held by only one person.  Previously, there were positions of First Vice President and Second Vice President, also known as First Designate to Presidency (\"Primer Designado a la Presidencia\") and Second Designate (\"Segundo Designado a la Presidencia\").  According to the current constitution, Vice Presidents are elected in the same ticket as the President.  However, the position of Second Vice President has been abolished since 2009. \n\nAbteilungsleiter (\"section leader\"), German for department head, was also a mid-level administrative political position of the Nazi Party, often held by staff political officers attached to various \"Gaue\" throughout Germany.  The position of Abteilungsleiter was not an actual Nazi Party political rank, but a title held by a Party member in addition to their formal rank.  The position was first created in 1933, after the Nazis had secured power in Germany. \n\nPub.L.  113\u2013167 (formerly the bill ), a United States public law, that is entitled \"to amend the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act to clarify how the Act applies to condominiums,\" is a bill that was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress.  The Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act of 1968 was passed in 1968 with the intention of helping protect consumers from land-related scams, but regulating the sale of land across state lines.  The act requires sellers to prepare center information about the piece of property they are trying to sell and disclose it in a \"Property Report.\"  The law was originally administered by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, but is currently run by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  H.R. 2600 would make changes to this law related to condominiums. \n\nHannah \"Annie\" Elizabeth Rolinson Gale (December 29, 1876 \u2013 August 7, 1970) was a British-born Canadian politician who was the first woman to hold an elected political position in Canada. \n\nAttorney misconduct is unethical or illegal conduct by an attorney.  Attorney Misconduct may include: conflict of interest, over billing, refusing to represent a client for political or professional motives, false or misleading statements, hiding evidence, abandoning a client, failing to disclose all relevant facts, arguing a position while neglecting to disclose prior law which might counter the argument, and\" in some instances\" having sex with a client. \n\nThe Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections Act, commonly known as the DISCLOSE Act and also known as H.R. 5175 (S.3628-Senate), was a bill introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Chris Van Hollen (D-Maryland) on April 29, 2010 and in the U.S. Senate by Charles Schumer (D-New York) on July 21, 2010. \n\nAlthough attempts to regulate campaign finance by legislation date back to 1867, the modern era of \"campaign finance reform\" in the United States begins with the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) of 1971 and, more importantly, 1974 amendments to that Act.  The 1971 FECA required candidates to disclose sources of campaign contributions and campaign expenditures.  The 1974 Amendments essentially rewrote the Act from top to bottom.  The 1974 Amendments placed statutory limits on contributions by individuals for the first time, and created the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as an independent enforcement agency.  It provided for broad new disclosure requirements, and limited the amounts that candidates could spend on their campaigns, or that citizens could spend separate from candidate campaigns to promote their political views.  Specifically, it attempted to restrict the influence of wealthy individuals by limiting individual donations to $1,000 and donations by political action committees (PACs) to $5,000.  However, the Act's provisions limiting expenditures were struck down as unconstitutional in the 1976 Supreme Court decision Buckley v. Valeo. \n\nWorld Tamil Movement (abbreviated WTM) is a non-profit organization created in 1986 run by Canadians of ethnic Tamil heritage.  Its president was Sitha Sithampalam until June, 2008.  The organisation has functioned as a community group that offers services such as translation, vocational training and a library for the Tamil population in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  It further organised cultural and sports leagues, and classes to help women and children integrate into the larger Canadian society.  It was further involved in relief efforts for the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.  It has also openly declared itself to share the politics of Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism, stating \"It's no secret that the World Tamil Movement supports the right of the Tamil people to self-determination in the Northern and Eastern part of Sri Lanka.  This is a political position \u2013 perhaps one that not everyone will agree with, but one that we are constitutionally entitled to hold.\" \n\nIn Norway, a State Secretary (Norwegian: \"statssekret\u00e6r\" ) is a partisan political position within the executive branch of government.  Contrary to the position Secretary of State in many other countries, the Norwegian State Secretary does not head his or her Ministry, rather, they are second in rank to a Minister.  Resembling a \"de facto\" vice minister, the State Secretary, however, cannot attend a Council of State, and does not act as a temporary Minister in case of illness or other leave of absence. \n\nModernization of Investigative Techniques Act, Bill-C74 was first introduced in the Canadian House of Commons on November 15, 2005.  Introduced as a part of a package of \u201clawful access\u201d proposals, Modernization of Investigative Techniques Act (MITA) if passed, would have required telephone and internet service providers to design, create and maintain interception capabilities into existing networks and into new technologies as they are introduced into Canada.  Second, it would have allowed law enforcement to compel telephone and internet service providers to disclose subscriber information without a warrant.  The bill failed to pass into law when Parliament was dissolved on November 28, 2005.  Lawful access legislation was, however, was re-introduced under the name Bill C-13 (short titled Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act) by Stephen Harper's Conservative government on November 20, 2013 and it passed through all legislative stages to receive royal assent on December 9, 2014. \n\n",

The show provides a performance space that is an alternative to live concerts and studio sessions for popular artists.  This allows the artists to \"\u2026have fun and [be] creatively spontaneous\".  The majority of shows include a segment in which Hall and the guest artist prepare food from different cuisines for everyone to eat.  The food comes from various local restaurants and the chefs of those establishments walk Hall and guest through the preparation of the food.  \"Live From Daryl's House\" expanded to broadcast TV but remained unchanged.  Hall was quoted by Billboard.com as saying \"it's an Internet show that is being shown on television, so I'm not adapting the show at all in any way to be a 'TV' show.\"  The show debuted in 95 markets on September 24, 2011, with back-to-back half-hour episodes featuring Train (Episode 33) and Fitz & the Tantrums (Episode 35).  Starting with the 66th episode of \"Live From Daryl's House\", the shows are filmed at Hall's club, Daryl's House, in Pawling, New York. \n\n\"One on One\" is a song performed by American musical duo Hall & Oates.

Daryl Hall performs lead vocals, while John Oates provides backing harmony vocals. \n\n\"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying\" is a song written and originally performed by British beat group Gerry and the Pacemakers.  The songwriting is credited to Gerry Marsden and the other band members, Freddie Marsden, Les Chadwick and Les Maguire.  It was first recorded by Louise Cordet, and then recorded by the group themselves in early 1964. \n\n\"Did It in a Minute\" is a song performed by American musical duo Hall & Oates.  Written by member Daryl Hall with Sara and Janna Allen.  The song was released as the third of four singles from their tenth studio album \"Private Eyes\" in March 1982.  Daryl Hall performs lead vocals, while John Oates provides backing harmony vocals. \n\n\"Say It Isn't So\" is a song by American duo Daryl Hall & John Oates written by Daryl Hall.  It was released by RCA Records in October 1983 as the first of two new singles from their compilation album \"Rock 'n Soul Part 1\", released that same year (see 1983 in music).  The song was remixed as a \"special extended dance mix\" by John \"Jellybean\" Benitez, which topped \"Billboard\" magazine's Hot Dance Club Play chart.  The song peaked at number 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for four weeks, coincidentally behind \"Say Say Say\" by Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson. \n\n",

The tunnel was driven by the Portland and Southwestern Railroad, whose chief business was logging.  Unusually for a logging railroad, the Portland and Southwestern built tunnels.  In order to reach the far side of the Nehalem divide in the Northern Oregon Coast Range, the railroad undertook a 1712 ft tunnel.  Some work was started in 1910, but most work began in 1918 and was completed in 1919.  Since the tunnel was not through solid rock, the tunnel was lined with timber.  The tunnel was used until 1945, when it was replaced by a truck road over the divide. \n\nAl Haj FAW motors is sole distributor and assembler of FAW vehicles in Pakistan.

In its upper stretch, it passes entirely within the city limits of Berkeley, and marks the city limit with the adjacent city of Albany in its lower section.  Before European settlement, Codornices probably had no direct, permanent connection to San Francisco Bay.  Like many other small creeks, it filtered through what early maps show as grassland to a large, northward-running salt marsh and slough that also carried waters from Marin Creek and Schoolhouse Creek.  A channel was cut through in the 19th Century, and Codornices flows directly to San Francisco Bay by way of a narrow remnant slough adjacent to Golden Gate Fields racetrack. \n\nJory Prum (January 31, 1975 \u2013 April 22, 2016), also known as Jory K.

The Key System consisted of local streetcar and bus lines in the East Bay, and commuter rail and bus lines connecting the East Bay to San Francisco by a ferry pier on San Francisco Bay, later via the lower deck of the Bay Bridge.  At its height during the 1940s, the Key System had over 66 mi of track.  The local streetcars were discontinued in 1948 and the commuter trains to San Francisco were discontinued in 1958.  The Key System's territory is today served by BART and AC Transit bus service. \n\n",

In the mortification, Dunbar's charitable purpose is recorded.  Bedesmen were supported by a charitable foundation that emerged from the original church control until the twenty-first century.  Bedesmen drew their name from the word \"bede\" - a prayer.  The residents of Dunbar's Hospital said prayers in a cycle of Divine Office.  The Bede House, Old Aberdeen was used by the Bedesmen from the hospital from 1789 to the end of the nineteenth century.  The only remains of the 1531 building can be seen in a perimeter wall for Seaton Park in Old Aberdeen.  The last Bedesman died in 1988.

        "context": "The Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame is a collection of plaques, mounted on a brick wall in the Ashburn Alley section of Citizens Bank Park, the ballpark of the Philadelphia Phillies.  From 1978 to 2003, the Phillies inducted one figure from their franchise history and one notable person from the Philadelphia Athletics (A's) organization each year\u2014with the exception of 1983, when the Phillies inducted their Centennial Team.  Once Veterans Stadium closed in 2003, the wall plaques used to recognize the Phillies' members were moved to Citizens Bank Park; however, the Phillies no longer induct notable Athletics.  Each person inducted into the Wall of Fame was honored with a metal plaque showing the person's face; their position with, and years of service to, the team; and a summary of their most important contributions.  In March 2004, the Athletics' plaques were relocated to the Philadelphia Athletics Historical Society in Hatboro, Pennsylvania, and a single plaque listing all of the A's inductees was attached to a statue of Connie Mack located across the street from Citizens Bank Park. \n\nThe Louden Monorail System in the Auto Repair Shop, also known as McGuire Motor Company and Crandall's Electric Service, is a historic structure located in Fairfield, Iowa, United States.  The monorail system is located in a former auto repair shop along an alley between East Broadway Avenue and East Briggs Avenue.  It is the rear, single-story, portion of the building at 117 E. Broadway Ave where the system is located.  The storefront portion of the building, also historically associated with the automobile industry, is a two-story brick building built on a stone foundation.  The east side of the central business district in Fairfield had become the center for automobile related businesses by the 1920s.  Harley Carter bought this building in 1920, and had the monorail system, manufactured by the Louden Machinery Company, installed about 1922.  The overhead material handling system is permanently attached to the east wall of the shop.  It allowed the mechanics to more easily move the heavy engines and other parts to and from vehicles.  The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. \n\nThe Market Theater Gum Wall is a brick wall covered in used chewing gum, in an alleyway in downtown Seattle.  It is located in Post Alley under Pike Place Market.  Similar to Bubblegum Alley in San Luis Obispo, California, the Market Theater Gum Wall is a local landmark.  Parts of the wall can be covered several inches thick, 15 feet high for 50 feet. \n\nThe Up Your Alley Fair, most commonly referred to by locals as Dore Alley Fair or simply Dore Alley is a leather and fetish event held in San Francisco, California on the last Sunday of July on Folsom Street between 9th and 10th Streets and on Dore Street from Howard Street to half a block southeast of Folsom Street.

It was built in 1811, and is a two- to three-story, five bay, stuccoed stone dwelling.  The three center bays project slightly from the main body of the house.  In 1935, a kitchen wing was added to the other end of the house plus a gated wall and garage.  The house was owned by the Du Pont family.  Also on the property is \"Chicken Alley,\" an excellent example of the 19th century workers' row house. \n\nBubblegum Alley is a tourist attraction in downtown San Luis Obispo, California, known for its accumulation of used bubble gum on the walls of an alley.  It is a 15 ft high and 70 ft long alley lined with chewed gum left by passers-by.  It covers a stretch of 20 meters in the 700 block of Higuera Street in downtown San Luis Obispo. \n\nOuch!  is a type of sugar-free bubble gum made by the Wm. Wrigley Jr.  Company under the Hubba Bubba brand name.  By the 1990s, the gum was available in the flavors of grape, watermelon, and strawberry.  Each stick of gum was wrapped with paper made to look like a bandage and was packaged in a metallic container similar to that of a bandage box.  In October 2009, the gum was redesigned to have a new look and packaging, and is now also available in bubblegum flavor.  Each pack comes with one of a possible twenty collectable games inside. \n\nThe Old US 67 Rest Area is a historic roadside rest area in rural Clark County, Arkansas.  It is located in on the west side of U.S. Route\u00a067 (US\u00a067) and an old paved section formerly designated Highway\u00a051, between the small towns of Curtis and Gum Springs.  The rest area consists of a semicircular fieldstone retaining wall, which is segmented by six fieldstone pillars.  A semicircular concrete bench stands facing a fieldstone well.  The rest area was built five years after US\u00a067 was paved in 1931, by the National Youth Administration, a federal New Deal agency, and the state highway department. \n\nThe Digital Media Factory is a multi-media design, production and post-production facility founded by Marty Collins and wife, Ginny Mitchell along with partners Ned Hearn and Brian Critchlow.  They are located in Santa Cruz, California in the former Wrigley Gum manufacturing facility located at 2809 Mission Street on the west end of Santa Cruz. \n\nHollywood Star Lanes was a 32-lane bowling alley located on Santa Monica Boulevard in Los Angeles, California.  Open from 1960 to 2002, the alley was featured in the movies \"The Big Lebowski\" and \"The Big Empty\", which was filmed on location over three weeks of the eleven-week filming schedule.  In 2002, the alley was closed after the Los Angeles Unified School District seized the land by eminent domain, with the goal of building an elementary school at the site. \n\n",

It was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 74th Academy Awards. \n\nKeith Richards (born 18 December 1943) is an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and author, best known as a founder member of the rock band the Rolling Stones. \" Rolling Stone\" magazine credited Richards for \"rock's greatest single body of riffs\" on guitar and ranked him 4th on its list of 100 best guitarists.  Fourteen songs that Richards wrote with the Rolling Stones' lead vocalist Mick Jagger are listed among \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".  The Stones are generally known for their guitar interplay of rhythm and lead (\"weaving\") between Richards and Brian Jones, Mick Taylor and Ronnie Wood over the years.  In spite of this, Richards plays the only guitar tracks on some of their most famous songs including \"Paint It Black\", \"Ruby Tuesday\", \"Sympathy for the Devil\" and \"Gimme Shelter\". \n\nMerry Clayton (born December 25, 1948) is an American soul and gospel singer and an actress.  She provided a number of backing vocal tracks for major performing artists in the 1960s, most notably in her duet with Mick Jagger on the Rolling Stones song \"Gimme Shelter.\"  Clayton is featured in \"20 Feet from Stardom\", the Oscar-winning documentary about background singers and their contributions to the music industry.  In 2013, she released \"The Best of Merry Clayton\", a compilation of her favorite songs. \n\nGimme Shelter is a 1970 documentary film directed by Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin chronicling the last weeks of The Rolling Stones' 1969 US tour which culminated in the disastrous Altamont Free Concert.  The film is named after \"Gimme Shelter\", the lead track from the group's 1969 album \"Let It Bleed\".  The film was screened at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival, but was not entered into the main competition. \n\nWenzell Baird Bryant (Columbus, Indiana, December 12, 1927 \u2013 Hemet, California, November 13, 2008) was an American filmmaker.  He is best known as the cameraman on the Albert Maysles film \"Gimme Shelter\" who filmed the fatal stabbing of Rolling Stones concertgoer Meredith Hunter by Hells Angel Alan Passaro at the Altamont Free Concert in December 1969. \n\nGimme Shelter is a compilation by The Rolling Stones, released on Decca Records in 1971.  It reached #19 on the U.K chart. \n\n\"Gimme Shelter\" is the opening track to the 1969 album Let It Bleed by the Rolling Stones.  Although the first word was spelled \"Gimmie\" on that album, subsequent recordings by the band and other musicians have made \"Gimme\" the customary spelling.  Greil Marcus, writing in \"Rolling Stone\" magazine at the time of its release, praised the song, stating that the band has \"never done anything better.\" \n\nAlamont Diary is the debut album by Melbourne electronica band Black Cab.  Released in 2004, it is a concept album based on the ill-fated 1969 free concert at Altamont Speedway in California headlined by the Rolling Stones.  The album, whose genre is described a psych-country, features audio samples of former Stones tour manager Sam Cutler, taken from the 1970 documentary film \"Gimme Shelter\". \n\n\"Gimme Shelter\" is a song by The Rolling Stones. \n\nStanton Hill is an American broadcast producer and voice actor.

The game is created by Klaus Teuber, the creator of \"Settlers\", and is published under license from Catan GmbH by Kosmos in German and Mayfair Games in English.  It is the second game in the \"Catan Histories\" series of board games.  Often games produced in different languages by different publishers have slight rule differences between the versions.  Catan Histories: Struggle for Rome is no exception. \n\nThe Settlers of Catan, sometimes shortened to Catan or Settlers, is a multiplayer board game designed by Klaus Teuber and first published in 1995 in Germany by Franckh-Kosmos Verlag (Kosmos) as Die Siedler von Catan.  Players assume the roles of settlers, each attempting to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources.  Players are awarded points as their settlements grow; the first to reach a set number of points, typically 10, is the winner.  The game and its many expansions are also published by Mayfair Games, Filosofia, Capcom, 999 Games, \u039a\u03ac\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1, and Devir. \n\nThe Catan Card Game, originally named The Settlers of Catan: The Card Game, is a card game adaptation of \"The Settlers of Catan\".

It is a dice game re-imagining of Teuber's most notable title, \"Settlers of Catan\".  \"Catan Dice Game\" can be played by any number of players, but is ideally suited for up to four.  A variation, known as \"Catan Dice Game Plus\", is freely available from the \"Catan\" website, whose gameplay is closer to its \"Settlers\" origins. \n\nElasund: The First City (German: \"Elasund - Die erste Stadt\" ; ] ) is a German-style board game designed by Klaus Teuber.  It is the second game in the \"Catan Adventures\" series (the first being \"\"), a series of spinoff games based on the theme from Teuber's hit game \"The Settlers of Catan\" as well as its German-language novelization by Rebecca Gabl\u00e9.  As a game in the \"Catan\" series, it is published by Kosmos in German and Mayfair Games in English.  Despite the thematic connection between \"Elasund\" and \"Settlers\", the two games have completely different mechanics. \n\nCatan: Seafarers, or Seafarers of Catan in older editions, (German: \"Die Seefahrer von Catan\" ) is an expansion of the board game \"The Settlers of Catan\" for three to four players (five-to-six-player play is also possible with both of the respective five-to-six-player extensions).  The main feature of this expansion is the addition of ships, gold rivers, and the pirate to the game, allowing play between multiple islands.

        "context": "Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft, or simply Tomb Raider III, is an action-adventure video game developed by Core Design and published by Eidos Interactive.  It was originally released for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows platforms in 1998.  \"Tomb Raider III\" is the third title in the \"Tomb Raider\" video game series and a sequel to \"Tomb Raider II\".  The story of the game follows archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft as she embarks upon a quest to recover four pieces of a meteorite that are scattered across the world.  To progress through the game, the player must explore five locations (India, South Pacific, London, Nevada, and Antarctica) and complete a series of levels that involve solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, and defeating enemies. \n\nLara Croft Go is a 2015 turn-based puzzle video game in the \"Tomb Raider\" series.  The player moves Lara Croft as a puzzle piece through a board game while avoiding obstacles and manipulating the environment.  The developers distilled major series motifs, such as boulder chases and reaction-based gameplay, to suit \"Lara Croft Go\"'s time-independent gameplay.  Square Enix Montreal developed the game as a spiritual successor to its 2014 \"Hitman Go\", based on another Square Enix franchise.  The company released \"Lara Croft Go\" in August 2015 for Android, iOS, Windows, and Windows Phone devices.  A version for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita was unveiled in November 2016. \n\nLara Croft is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the Square Enix (previously Eidos Interactive) video game franchise \"Tomb Raider\".  She is presented as a highly intelligent, athletic, and beautiful English archaeologist-adventurer who ventures into ancient, hazardous tombs and ruins around the world.  Created by a team at UK developer Core Design that included Toby Gard, the character first appeared in the 1996 video game \"Tomb Raider\".  She has also appeared in video game sequels, printed adaptations, a series of animated short films, feature films (portrayed by Angelina Jolie, later by Alicia Vikander), and merchandise related to the series.  Official promotion of the character includes a brand of apparel and accessories, action figures, and model portrayals.  Croft has also been licensed for third-party promotion, including television and print advertisements, music-related appearances, and as a spokesmodel.  As of June 2016, Lara Croft has been featured on over 1,100 magazine covers surpassing any supermodel. \n\nLara Croft and the Temple of Osiris is an action-adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.  It is the sequel to the 2010 video game \"Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light\", and the second instalment in \"Lara Croft\" spin-off series of the \"Tomb Raider\" franchise.  The video game was announced at E3 2014 on 9 June.  \"Temple of Osiris\" stars \"Tomb Raider\" mainstay protagonist Lara Croft, voiced by English actress Keeley Hawes. \n\nAlice David (born 22 March 1987) is a French actress, known for the television series \"Bref\" (2011) and the film \"Babysitting\" (2014).  She is the voice of the French dub of Lara Croft in the video game \"Tomb Raider\". \n\nLara Croft and the Guardian of Light is an action-adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Android and, iOS through digital distribution.  It is part of the \"Tomb Raider\" series, but unlike previous games, the game does not carry the \"Tomb Raider\" brand and has a heavy emphasis on cooperative gameplay.  In multiplayer, players take the role as either Lara Croft or a 2,000-year-old Mayan warrior named Totec.  They must work together in order to stop the evil spirit Xolotl and retrieve the Mirror of Smoke.  A single-player campaign mode is available that does not include the non-playable character AI following or helping Lara. \n\nToby Gard (born 1972 in Chelmsford, Essex) is an English computer game character designer and consultant, notably being part of the team that created fictional female British archaeologist Lara Croft.  Lara Croft was awarded a \"Guinness World Record\" recognizing her as the \"most successful human video game heroine.\" \n\nLara Croft: Tomb Raider (also known as simply Tomb Raider) is a 2001 action-adventure film based on the popular \"Tomb Raider\" video game series featuring the character Lara Croft portrayed by Angelina Jolie.  An international co-production between the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany, it was directed by Simon West and revolves around Lara Croft trying to obtain ancient artifacts from the enemy, the Illuminati. \n\nTomb Raider, also known as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider between 2001 and 2007, is a media franchise that originated with an action-adventure video game series created by British gaming company Core Design.  Formerly owned by Eidos Interactive, then by Square Enix after their acquisition of Eidos in 2009, the franchise focuses on a fictional English archaeologist Lara Croft, who travels around the world searching for lost artifacts and infiltrating dangerous tombs and ruins.  The gameplay generally focuses around action-adventure exploration of environments, solving puzzles, navigating hostile environments filled with traps, and fighting numerous enemies.  Additional media has grown up around the theme in the form of film adaptations, comics and novels. \n\nTomb Raider is a media franchise consisting of action-adventure games, comic books, novels, theme park rides, and movies, centring on the adventures of the female fictional British archaeologist Lara Croft.  Since the release of the original \"Tomb Raider\" in 1996, the series developed into a lucrative franchise of related media, and Lara went on to become a major icon of the video game industry.  The \"Guinness Book of World Records\" has recognised Lara Croft as the \"Most Successful Human Videogame Heroine\" in 2006.  Six games in the series were developed by Core Design, and the latest four by Crystal Dynamics.  All the games were first published by Eidos Interactive, now Eidos officially became part of Square Enix on 22 April 2009, meaning Square Enix owns the rights to the \"Tomb Raider\" trademark and characters of the franchise.  To date two movies, \"\" and \"\", have been produced starring American actress Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft.  A reboot was announced in 2016. \n\n",

A single from the album titled \"Heavy\" was released worldwide.  The band was formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1996 by three high school friends; Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson.  The group later expanded to a six piece when they added Joe Hahn, Dave \"Phoenix\" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to the line-up.  Mark Wakefield was later changed by lead vocalist Chester Bennington.  After facing numerous rejections from several major record labels, Linkin Park turned to Jeff Blue for additional help.  After failing to catch Warner Bros.  Records on three previous reviews, Jeff Blue, now the vice president of Warner Bros.  Records, helped the band sign a deal with the company in 1999.  The band released its breakthrough album, \"Hybrid Theory\", the following year.  The album produced four singles, \"One Step Closer\", \"Crawling\", \"Papercut\" and \"In the End\".  The album included a total of twelve songs in addition with two special edition tracks available in Japan.  Later in 2002 the band released a Remix album \"Reanimation\", which would include works from \"Hybrid Theory\" and non-album tracks.  \"Reanimation\" debuted on July 30, 2002, featuring the likes of Black Thought, Jonathan Davis, Aaron Lewis, and many others.  \"Reanimation\" claimed the second spot on the \"Billboard\" 200, and sold nearly 270,000 copies during its debut week.

RNS occasionally used the tagline \"Rabid Neurosis - Spread The Epidemic.\"  RNS were best known for releasing highly anticipated albums by hip hop, pop, rock and dance artists weeks and sometimes months before their official release date.  RNS is known to have greatly contributed to the mp3 scene.  After their group was mentioned in an MTV News article about the early leak of the Eminem album \"Encore\", RNS stopped including their initials in filenames and ID3 tags. \n\nBarbara Higbie (born 1958) is a Grammy nominated, Bammy award winning pianist, composer, violinist, singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist.

As a junior officer he took part in the Flanders Campaign, in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and in the suppression of Robert Emmet's insurrection in 1803.  He commanded a cavalry brigade in Sir Arthur Wellesley's Army before being given overall command of the cavalry in the latter stages of the Peninsular War.  He went on to be Commander-in-Chief, Ireland and then Commander-in-Chief, India.  In the latter role he stormed Bharatpur\u2014a fort which previously had been deemed impregnable. \n\nMaharaja Surajmal Brij University, Bharatpur, formerly Brij University, Bharatpur, is a state university located at Bharatpur, Rajasthan, India.  It was established in 2012 by the Government of Rajasthan through \"Brij University, Bharatpur Act, 2012\".  In 2014, in commemoration of Maharaja Surajmal, it was renamed Maharaja Surajmal Brij University, Bharatpur through \"Brij University, Bharatpur (Change of Name) Act, 2014\".  Ashwini Kumar Bansal was appointed Vice Chancellor of the university in February 2017. \n\nCommander-in-Chief, Land Forces (CINCLAND), was a senior officer in the British Army.  CINCLAND commanded HQ Land Forces, an administrative apparatus that had responsibility for all of the army's fighting units in the United Kingdom (excluding Northern Ireland), Germany and Brunei, together with training garrisons in Nepal, Belize, Canada and Kenya.  CINCLAND was also the Standing Joint Commander (UK) (SJC(UK)), with responsibility for the provision of Military Aid to Civil Power within the United Kingdom.  The position had existed since 1968, when it was known as General Officer Commanding Army Strategic Command.  In 1972 it became Commander-in-Chief United Kingdom Land Forces (CINCUKLF).  As from 1 April 2008, HQ Land Command was renamed HQ Land Forces (HQLF).  Therefore, the Commander-in-Chief became Commander-in-Chief of HQ Land Forces. \n\nDuring the period of the British Raj, the Commander-in-Chief, India (often \"Commander-in-Chief \"in\" or \"of\" India\") was the supreme commander of the British Indian Army.  The Commander-in-Chief and most of his staff were based at General Headquarters, India, and liaised with the civilian Governor-General of India.  Following the Partition of India in 1947 and the creation of the independent dominions of India and Pakistan, the post was abolished.  It was briefly replaced by the position of Supreme Commander of India and Pakistan before the role was abolished in November 1948.  Subsequently, the role of Commander-in-Chief was merged into the offices of the Governors-General of India and Pakistan, respectively, before becoming part of the office of President of India from 1950, of the President of Pakistan from 1956, and of the President of Bangladesh from 1972. \n\nVishvendra Singh (Born 23 June 1962 at Moti Mahal, Bharatpur) is a member of the Legislative Assembly from Deeg-Kumher Constituency in Bharatpur district of Rajasthan India.  He is the son of the last ruler of the princely state of Bharatpur.  In the 26th amendment to the Constitution of India promulgated in 1971, the Government of India abolished all official symbols of princely India, including titles, privileges, and remuneration (privy purses). \n\nField Marshal Sir Claude John Eyre Auchinleck {'1': \", '2': \", '3': \", '4': \"} (21 June 1884 \u2013 23 March 1981) was a British Army commander during the Second World War.  He was a career soldier who spent much of his military career in India, where he rose to become Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Army by early 1941.  In July 1941 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East theatre, but after initial successes the war in North Africa turned against the British, and he was relieved of the post in 1942 during the crucial Alamein campaign.  In June 1943 he was once more appointed Commander-in-Chief India, where his support through the organisation of supply, maintenance and training for Slim's Fourteenth Army played an important role in its success.  He served as Commander-in-Chief India until Partition in 1947, when he assumed the role of Supreme Commander of all British forces in India and Pakistan until late 1948. \n\nThe Siege of Bharatpur took place between 2 January and 22 February 1805 in the Indian Princely state of Bharatpur (now part of Rajasthan), during the Second Anglo-Maratha War.  Forces of the British East India Company, led by General Gerard Lake, were four times repulsed in attempts to storm the fortress.  The victory by Bharatpur backed by the Maratha Empire was an embarrassing defeat for the British. \n\nBharatpur District is a district of Rajasthan state in western India also known as Jat Kingdom.  The town of Bharatpur is the district headquarters.  Bharatpur District is a part of National Capital Region (NCR). \n\nBharatpur is a city and newly created municipal corporation in the Indian state of Rajasthan.  Located in the Braj region, Bharatpur was once considered to be impregnable and unbeatable.  The city is situated 180\u00a0km south of India's capital, New Delhi, 178\u00a0km from Rajasthan's capital Jaipur, 55\u00a0km west of Agra and 34\u00a0km from Lord Krishna's birthplace Mathura.  It is also the administrative headquarters of Bharatpur District and the headquarters of Bharatpur Division of Rajasthan.  The Royal House of Bharatpur traces its history to the 11th century.  Bharatpur is part of National Capital Region (NCR). \n\nLohagarh Fort (Iron fort) is situated at Bharatpur in Rajasthan, India.  It was constructed by Bharatpur Jat rulers.  Maharaja Suraj Mal used all his power and wealth to a good cause, and built numerous forts and palaces across his kingdom, one of them being the Lohagarh Fort (Iron fort), which was one of the strongest ever built in Indian history.  The inaccessible Lohagarh fort could withstand repeated attacks of British forces led by Lord Lake in 1805 when they laid siege for over six weeks.  Of the two gates in the fort, one in the north is known as Ashtdhaatu (eight metalled) gate while the one facing the south is called Chowburja (four-pillared) gate. \n\n",

        "context": "\"Santa Claus Is a Black Man\" is a Christmas song by record producer and songwriter Teddy Vann, performed by his daughter Akim Vann (billed as Akim) and his Teddy Vann Production Company for a 1973 single.  The song, described as \"Vann's take on 'I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus'\", has been called a cult classic, and continues to receive Christmas airplay. \n\nSanta Claus is a 1898 British short silent drama film, directed by George Albert Smith, which features Santa Claus visiting a house on Christmas Eve.  The film, according to Michael Brooke of BFI Screenonline, \"is believed to be the cinema's earliest known example of parallel action and, when coupled with double-exposure techniques that Smith had already demonstrated in the same year's \"The Mesmerist\" (1898) and \"Photographing a Ghost\" (1898), the result is one of the most visually and conceptually sophisticated British films made up to then.\" \n\nThe Year Without a Santa Claus is a 90-minute 2006 live-action remake of the Rankin-Bass classic \"The Year Without a Santa Claus\" which premiered on NBC December 11, 2006.  A widescreen DVD was released on December 12, 2006 (UPC 085391115120). \n\nMotion pictures featuring Santa Claus abound and apparently constitute their own subgenre of the Christmas film genre.  Early films of Santa revolve around similar simple plots of Santa's Christmas Eve visit to children.  In 1897, in a short film called \"Santa Claus Filling Stockings\", Santa Claus is simply filling stockings from his pack of toys.  Another film called \"Santa Claus and the Children\" was made in 1898.  A year later, a film directed by George Albert Smith in titled \"Santa Claus\" (or \"The Visit from Santa Claus\" in the United Kingdom) was created.  In this picture, Santa Claus enters the room from the fireplace and proceeds to trim the tree.  He then fills the stockings that were previously hung on the mantle by the children.  After walking backward and surveying his work, he suddenly darts at the fireplace and disappears up the chimney.  \"Santa Claus' Visit\" in 1900 featured a scene with two little children kneeling at the feet of their mother and saying their prayers.  The mother tucks the children snugly in bed and leaves the room.  Santa Claus suddenly appears on the roof, just outside the children's bedroom window, and proceeds to enter the chimney, taking with him his bag of presents and a little hand sled for one of the children.  He goes down the chimney and suddenly appears in the children's room through the fireplace.  He distributes the presents and mysteriously causes the appearance of a Christmas tree laden with gifts.  The scene closes with the children waking up and running to the fireplace just too late to catch him by the legs.  A 1909 film by D. W. Griffith titled \"A Trap for Santa Claus\" shows children setting a trap to capture Santa Claus as he descends the chimney, but instead capture their father who abandoned them and their mother but tries to burglarize the house after he discovers she inherited a fortune.  A twenty-nine-minute 1925 silent film production titled \"Santa Claus\", by explorer/documentarian Frank E. Kleinschmidt, filmed partly in northern Alaska, feature Santa in his workshop, visiting his Eskimo neighbors, and tending his reindeer.  A year later, another movie titled \"Santa Claus\" was produced with sound on De Forest Phonofilm.  Over the years, various actors have donned the red suit (aside from those discussed below), including Monty Woolley in \"Life Begins at Eight-thirty\" (1942), Alberto Rabagliati in \"The Christmas That Almost Wasn't\" (1966), Dan Aykroyd in \"Trading Places\" (1983), Jan Rubes in \"One Magic Christmas\" (1985), David Huddleston in \"\" (1985), Jonathan Taylor Thomas in \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" (1998), and Ed Asner in \"Elf\" (2003).  Later films about Santa vary, but can be divided into the following themes. \n\nA Miser Brothers' Christmas is a stop motion spin-off special based on some of the characters from the 1974 Rankin-Bass special \"The Year Without a Santa Claus\".  Distributed by Warner Bros.  Animation under their Warner Premiere label (the rights holders of the post-1974 Rankin-Bass library) and Toronto-based Cuppa Coffee Studios, the one-hour special premiered on ABC Family on Saturday, December 13, 2008, during the network's annual The 25 Days of Christmas programming.  Mickey Rooney and George S. Irving reprised their respective roles as Santa Claus and Heat Miser at ages 88 and 86.  Snow Miser, originally portrayed by Dick Shawn who died in 1987, was voiced by Juan Chioran, while Mrs. Claus, voiced by Shirley Booth in the original, was portrayed by Catherine Disher (because Booth had died in 1992).  The movie aimed to emulate the Rankin/Bass animation style.  This is the last Christmas special to feature Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus, as he died in 2014, as well as the last time George Irving voiced Heat Miser, as he died in 2016. \n\nSanta's Workshop is an amusement park that opened on June 16, 1956 in Cascade, Colorado, just west of Colorado Springs at the base of Pikes Peak.  Modeled after the Santa's Workshop in Lake Placid, New York, the park features a charming North Pole village complete with specialty shops for boys, girls, Christmas ornaments, and candy.  The village is also home to Santa's Workshop itself, where children can meet with Santa Claus and Mrs. Claus year round.  Many of the park's staff get into the holiday spirit as well, and children will find Santa's elves hard at work in admissions and the many shops around the premises. \n\nThe Year Without a Santa Claus is a 1974 Christmas stop motion animated television special produced by Rankin/Bass Productions.  The story is based on Phyllis McGinley's 1956 book of the same name, illustrated by Kurt Werth.  It was originally broadcast on December 10, 1974 on ABC. \n\nSanta Claus: The Movie (known on-screen as simply Santa Claus) is a 1985 British-American Christmas film starring Dudley Moore, John Lithgow, and David Huddleston in the title role.  It is the last major fantasy film produced by the Paris-based father-and-son production team of Alexander and Ilya Salkind.  The film was directed by Jeannot Szwarc and released in North America on November 27, 1985, by TriStar Pictures.  The 2005 DVD release was released by Anchor Bay Entertainment, now known as Starz Home Entertainment, under license from the film's current owner, StudioCanal; however, the current, 25th Anniversary home video release (which also now includes Blu-ray) is by Lionsgate Home Entertainment, again under StudioCanal's license. \n\nLarry Wilson is an American film producer and screenwriter.  He is best known for his screenwriting work on the films \"Beetlejuice\" (1988) and \"The Addams Family\" (1991).  He also co-wrote the films \"The Little Vampire\" (2001) and the television film \"The Year Without a Santa Claus\" (2006).  He also wrote and directed a number of episodes of the \"Tales from the Crypt\" television series from 1991 to 1996. \n\nJonathan Meath (born September 16, 1955) is an American TV producer based in Boston who is notable for children's television production.  He was Senior Producer of the TV game show \"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? \" He produced \"Zoom (1999)\" and \"The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss.\"  He co-founded a production company called Andanzura.  In addition, he is notable for having a dual career as a professional Santa Claus.  He made numerous appearances in various media as Santa, including ABC's \"Good Morning America\" show, and at New York's Radio City Music Hall with The Rockettes.  He appeared on the cover of \"Boston Magazine\" as \"Father Christmas\".  He was described by \"National Public Radio\" and \"Time Magazine\" as a \"top Santa\", and appeared as Santa in a Delta Airline's in-flight safety video.  He is featured as Santa in Coca-Cola\u2019s worldwide 2016 holiday advertising campaign both in print and commercials titled \u201cA Coke for Christmas.\" \n\n",

During his career, he won two mixed doubles titles at the French Open: in 1990 with Arantxa S\u00e1nchez, and in 1988 with Lori McNeil.  He reached the round of 16 in singles at the 1988 US Open and also the semifinal in doubles that same year.

Lozano was one of the four founding members of Moenia, which originally included Juan Carlos Lozano as lead vocalist on 1997's debut album 'Moenia' and its 1998 companion remix album 'Moenia Mixes'.  Despite the acclaimed success of 1997's Moenia and 1998's remix album, in itself a risky and previously-unheard of novelty in the Mexican music industry, and due to disagreements between Lozano, Jorge Soto and Alejandro 'Midi' Ortega as to the creative route Moenia should take, Lozano decided to leave Moenia as vocalist with original founding member Alfonso Pichardo returning as lead singer.  Lozano then formed the perhaps less commercial, still synth-oriented, but more guitar-centered Morbo, whose musical vision first came to fruition in 2001's eponymous \"Morbo\". \n\nJorge Lozano and Todd Witsken won in the final 6\u20133, 7\u20136 against Pieter Aldrich and Danie Visser. \n\nMarta Domachowska (; born 16 January 1986 in Warsaw) is a Polish retired professional tennis player ranked World No. 37 in singles (2006) and World No. 62 in doubles (2006).

        "context": "Truth Initiative (formerly the American Legacy Foundation or Legacy) is a nonprofit tobacco control organization \"dedicated to achieving a culture where all youth and young adults reject tobacco.\"  It was established in March 1999 as a result of the Master Settlement Agreement between the attorneys general of 46 states, the District of Columbia and five United States territories, and the tobacco industry.  Truth Initiative is best known for its youth smoking prevention campaign.  Its other primary aims include conducting tobacco control research and policy studies, organizing community and youth engagement programs and developing digital cessation and prevention products, including through revenue-generating models.  The organization changed its name from the American Legacy Foundation to Truth Initiative on September 8, 2015, to better align with its Truth campaign.  As of 2016, the organization had more than $957 million in assets and a staff of 133 based primarily in its Washington, D.C. office. \n\nTruth in Science is a United Kingdom-based creationist organization which promotes the Discovery Institute's \"Teach the Controversy\" campaign, which it uses to try to get pseudoscientific intelligent design creationism taught alongside evolution in school science lessons.  The organization claims that there is scientific controversy about the validity of Darwinian evolution, a view rejected by the United Kingdom's Royal Society and over 50 Academies of Science around the world.  The group is affiliated with the Discovery Institute, the hub of the intelligent design movement, following its strategy and circulating the Institute's promotional materials. \n\nThe Last Embrace is the final release by Spirit Caravan.  It was released on 2xCD and 2xLP in 2003 by Meteor City Records.  It contains 19 songs from their two albums, \"Jug Fulla Sun\" and \"Elusive Truth\", the three songs that appeared on their debut 7\" (under the name Shine), the two songs from their final 7\", \"Spirit Caravan\", the song from their split 7\" with Sixty Watt Shaman and their song from the Rise 13 compilation on Rise Above Records.  It also features the last three songs Spirit Caravan recorded, \"The Last Embrace,\" \"Brainwashed\" and \"Dove-Tongued Aggressor.\" \n\nCuriosity is an American documentary television series that premiered on August 7, 2011, on the Discovery Channel.  Each episode focuses on one question in science, technology, and society (e.g., why the  sank) and, for the first season, features a different celebrity host.  Stephen Hawking hosted the premiere episode titled \"Did God Create the Universe?\" , which aired simultaneously on seven Discovery Communications networks: Discovery Channel, TLC, Discovery Fit and Health, Animal Planet, Science, Investigation Discovery, and Destination America.  Season one consists of 16 episodes. \n\nTruth (stylized as truth) is a national campaign aimed at curbing youth smoking in the United States.  The \"truth\" campaign is produced and funded by the American Legacy Foundation, a public health nonprofit organization established in 1999 under the Master Settlement Agreement between U.S. tobacco companies, 46 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and five territories.  \"truth\" produces television and online content to promote anti-tobacco messages.  In August 2014, \"truth\" launched \"Finish It\", a redesigned campaign encouraging youth to be the generation that ends smoking. \n\nAn unforgiving sun, a parched earth, and a failed economy have left a small Texas town desolate.  For ten years Promise, Texas has known nothing but one curse after another.  It's barren, broken, and dying, leaving a town full of despair.  When a couple finds a boy walking along a dusty road, alone in the middle of nowhere, with nothing but a mat tucked under his arm, they pick him up in hopes of helping him.  What they don't realize is that he has come to help them and the residents of Promise.  No one knows who he is or where he came from.  Some think he's an answer to prayer.  Others think he's a runaway or a false prophet.  And the only thing this boy will say about himself is that he's here to help.  The town's sheriff, Brody, is determined to uncover the truth.  But Brody has his own problems trying to hold a dying town together.  Miracle after miracle takes place and the residents of Promise embrace the boy.  But when the beloved town doctor dies, it is time for the truth to be revealed.  The boy pleads with Brody in front of the whole town to believe that he's come to help, not to hurt anyone.  Finally, with his back against the wall the boy reveals his true identity. \n\nThe Discovery Museum and Planetarium is a hands-on science museum in Bridgeport, Connecticut, that serves as both a tourist destination and an educational resource for area schools.  The Discovery Museum provides dynamic, hands-on STEM experiences designed to resonate with the innate curiosity, learning desire, and spirit of exploration of visitors, encouraging young learners to ask questions, solve problems, and engineer solutions today so they are better prepared to embrace the challenges of tomorrow. \n\nDiscovery Networks Benelux is a branch of Discovery Networks International responsible for channels in the Netherlands and Belgium.  Discovery Networks Benelux operates Discovery, Animal Planet, TLC (Netherlands), Eurosport 1, Eurosport 2 and Investigation Discovery in the region with local advertising, sponsorship, programming and the use of the local language either dubbed or subtitled.  Discovery Networks Benelux also use existing services from Discovery Networks International: Discovery Science and Discovery World. \n\nEvery Voice is an American nonprofit, nonpartisan liberal political advocacy organization.  The organization was formed in 2014 upon the merger of the Public Campaign Action Fund, a 501(c)(4) group, and the Friends of Democracy.  Every Voice, along with its affiliated Super PAC, Every Voice Action, advocates for campaign finance reform in the United States via public financing of political campaigns and limitations on political donations.  The organization's president, David Donnelly, has said \"We fully embrace the irony of working through a Super PAC to fight the influence of Super PACs.\" \n\nExtrema formed in 1986 in Milan.  The initial lineup included guitarist Tommy Massara, vocalist/guitarist Andrea Boria, bassist Luca Varisco, and drummer Stefano Bullegas.  Regarded as one of Italy's first thrash metal bands, Extrema's first EP, \"We F**kin' Care\" (1987), sold an impressive 3,000 copies by word of mouth alone.  Italian heavy metal fans didn't yet seem prepared to embrace local talent, however, and the next four years saw Extrema (by then entirely re-vamped, with Massara signing on new members Gianluca Perotti on vocals, Mattia Bigi on bass, and Chris Dalla Pellegrina on drums) relegated to open for visiting acts like Slayer, D.R.I., and Corrosion of Conformity.  Finally realizing that their only hope of impressing local talent scouts lay in conquering from the outside-in, Extrema started aggressively shopping their demos to international heavy metal critics, and even financed a trip to New York City for a one-off gig.  The strategy worked, and their four-track demo from 1991 was soon making waves with some major international publications, eventually leading to a record deal with Contempo Records.  The result was the 1993's \"Tension at the Seams\" album, which led to stadium support slots with Italian rock star Vasco Rossi, and more importantly a high-profile metal festival appearance in Turin alongside Megadeth, The Cult, Suicidal Tendencies, and Metallica.  The album also featured an unconventional cover of The Police's \"Truth Hits Everybody\" and spawned a video clip for the track \"Child O' Boogaow\" which was on heavy rotation on Italy's MTV affiliate, Videomusic. \n\n",

The album was temporarily released via Rum Bum Records on September 3, 2013.  The album is no longer available for purchase as the band rereleased the album as \"Rise Up\" features all of its songs except \"Animal\", \"Flesh\", and \"I.D.N.A.E\". \n\n\"We Bring an Arsenal\" was supposed to be the second single from \"Weapons\", the fifth studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Lostprophets, planned to be released 4 June 2012.  It has been released to rock radio since this date in the United States, but the single has yet to be officially released in the UK as of 5 June 2012, but will unlikely happen due to Ian Watkins's imprisonment in 2013.  It was first played live on 25 February 2012 at Brisbane, Australia. \n\nUnder Your Skin is the seventh studio album by American rock band Saliva.  It is the final album to feature singer Josey Scott, who left the band in 2012.  It was released on March 22, 2011.  Prior to release, the album had been titled both \"Take That Society\" and \"Skin Deep\". \n\nJosey Scott (born Joseph Scott Sappington; May 3, 1972) is the former lead vocalist of the rock band Saliva.  In addition to Saliva, Scott co-wrote and performed \"Hero\" (which was used as one of the theme songs to the 2002 film \"Spider-Man\") with Chad Kroeger of Nickelback. \n\n\"For He's a Jolly Good Felon\" is the third single from the album \"The Betrayed\", the fourth album by Welsh alternative rock band Lostprophets.  According to the band's mailing list, the single is set to be released on 11 April 2010.  The single's formats will include 7\" vinyl (to be released on 12 April), a digital download, an iTunes single (including a live version of \"Dirty Little Heart\"), and a remix version by L'Amour La Morgue (Ian Watkins' side project).  The cover for the single was posted to Dragonninja.com on 1 March 2010. \n\n\"Always\" is the first single off the album \"Back into Your System\" by the rock band Saliva with lead vocalist Josey Scott.  It made it to number 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks for one week in February 2003, and has been Saliva's most successful hit, peaking at #51 on the Hot 100. \n\n\"Family Reunion\" is the first single from Saliva's sixth studio album, \"Cinco Diablo\".  Lead singer Josey Scott has said that the song is about meeting their fans on the road.  The song peaked at #14 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 2008. \n\nLostprophets were a Welsh rock band from Pontypridd, Wales formed in 1997.  Founded by lead vocalist and lyricist Ian Watkins, bassist (later guitarist) Mike Lewis, drummer Mike Chiplin and guitarist Lee Gaze, they were originally a side-project to hardcore punk band Public Disturbance.  They were also part of the Cardiff music scene. \n\n\"Where We Belong\" is the second single from the album \"The Betrayed\", the fourth studio album by Welsh alternative rock band Lostprophets.  It was released on 4 January 2010.  Vocalist Ian Watkins commented to \"Kerrang! \": \"Where We Belong might sound really happy and catchy, but if you really listen to the lyrics I could be saying that we belong in hell.\"  The single reached No. 32 on the Official UK top 40 on 10 January 2010.  The track was described by the band as their \"love letter to being home,\" having written the song after returning to their native Wales after recording in Los Angeles. \n\n\"Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja\" is a song by Welsh rock band Lostprophets.  Written by frontman Ian Watkins, the song was released in 2001 as the first single from the band's debut studio album, \"The Fake Sound of Progress\".  It was the only charting single on the \"Billboard\" charts from the album, and was still on the band's tour setlist when they broke up in 2013. \n\n",

        "context": "The Reading Post (until 2009, the Reading Evening Post), was an English local newspaper covering Reading, Berkshire and surrounding areas.  The title page of the paper featured the Maiwand Lion, a famous local landmark at Forbury Gardens.  The paper was most recently published by Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd., a division of Trinity Mirror plc. \n\nSt James's Church is a Roman Catholic church situated in the centre of the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.  It is located adjacent to the remaining ruins of Reading Abbey, between the Forbury Gardens and Reading Gaol. \n\nThe York City War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the north of England.  Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial.  Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose.  Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument.  The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York.  Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials.  Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's.  Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location.  This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds. \n\nSpalding War Memorial is a First World War memorial in the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall (pronounced ) in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in eastern England.  It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens.  The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war.  She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross.  The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council.  When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested.  After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building. \n\nThe Maiwand Lion is a sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire.  The statue was named after the Battle of Maiwand and was erected in 1884 to commemorate the deaths of 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot during the campaign in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in Afghanistan between 1878 and 1880.  It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion. \n\nKargil War Memorial, also known as the Vijaypath, is a war memorial built by the Indian Army, located in Dras, in the foothills of the Tololing Hill.  The memorial is located about 5\u00a0km from the city centre across the Tiger Hill.  It is located on the Srinagar-Leh National Highway 1D.  The memorial is in the memory of the soldiers and officers of the Indian Army who were killed during the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan.  The conflict later became known as the \"Kargil War\".  The memorial has a huge epitaph with names of all the officers and soldiers who died in war.  Kargil Vijay Diwas is celebrated on 26 July every year at the memorial simultaneously the Prime Minister of India pays tribute to the soldiers at Amar Jawan Jyothi at the India Gate, New Delhi. The main attraction of the whole memorial is the Sandstone wall, in the open, which has the names of all the Indian army personnel, who laid their lives during the Kargil war besides there is also a souvenir shop.  Visitors to the memorial can also see from there, some of the peaks that the Indian army captured back from Pakistan.  A giant national flag, weighing 15\u00a0kg was hoisted at the Kargil war memorial to commemorate the 13th anniversary of India\u2019s victory in the war \n\nManchester Cenotaph is a First World War memorial, with additions for later conflicts, by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter's Square in Manchester, England.  Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities\u2014the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922.  The committee quickly raised \u00a310,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial.  The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community.  The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church.  Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ. \n\nForbury Gardens is a public park in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.  The park is on the site of the outer court of Reading Abbey, which was in front of the Abbey Church.  The site was formerly known as the Forbury, and one of the roads flanking the current gardens is still known as The Forbury.  Fairs were held on the site three times a year until the 19th century. \n\nThe Devon County War Memorial is a First World War memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and situated on the cathedral green in Exeter, the county town of Devon, in the south west of England.  It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city.  The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds.  After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead.  The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations.  A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials\u2014the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens. \n\nThe Forbury Hotel (formerly Shire Hall) is a grade II listed hotel in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.  It is situated on the southern side of Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town centre. \n\n",

The Tasmanian mainland itself is an island, with an area of 64,103 km2 - 94.1% of the total land area of the state of Tasmania.  The eleven next largest islands have a combined area of 3,826 km2 , for a cumulative total of 99.75% of the state.  Over 300 smaller islands make up the remaining 173 km2 of total land area. \n\nThe Ashanti Region is located in south Ghana and is third largest of 10 administrative regions, occupying a total land surface of 24389 km2 or 10.2 per cent of the total land area of Ghana.  In terms of population, however, it is the most populated region with a population of 4,780,380 according to the 2010 census, accounting for 19.4% of Ghana\u2019s total population.  The Ashanti Region is known for its major gold bar and cocoa production.  The largest city and regional capital is Kumasi. \n\nThe Philippines is an archipelago that consists of 7,641 islands with a total land area of 301780 km2 .  The 11 largest islands contain 95% of the total land area.  The largest of these islands is Luzon at about 105000 km2 .  The next largest island is Mindanao at about 95000 km2 .  The archipelago is around 800 km from the Asian mainland and is located between Taiwan and Borneo. \n\nThe Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD.  The islands were known to the Norse as the \"Su\u00f0reyjar\", or \"Southern Isles\" as distinct from the \"Nor\u00f0reyjar\" or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland.  The historical record is incomplete and the kingdom was probably not a continuous entity throughout the entire period.  The islands concerned are sometimes referred to as the \"Kingdom of Mann and the Isles\", although only some of the later rulers claimed that title.  At times the rulers were independent of external control, although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland or Orkney.  At times there also appear to have been competing claims for all or parts of the territory.  The islands involved have a total land area of over 8300 km2 and extend for more than 500 km from north to south. \n\nAonghus M\u00f3r mac Domhnaill (died c.1293) was a leading figure in the thirteenth-century kingdoms of the Isles and Scotland.  He was a son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, a branch of Clann Somhairle.  Aonghus M\u00f3r appears to have succeeded his father in the mid part of the thirteenth century.  At the time, the rulers of the Isles were fiercely independent of the Scottish Crown, and owed nominal allegiance to the distant Norwegian Crown.  Aonghus M\u00f3r's first certain appearance in the historical record seems to evince his involvement in aiding native Irish kindreds against the consolidation of Anglo-Irish authority in the north-west Ireland.  Such cooperation could have been undertaken in the context of overseas kindreds like Clann Domhnaill constructing Irish alliances to gain assistance against Scottish encroachment. \n\nThe Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD.

At times there also appear to have been competing claims for all or parts of the territory.  The islands involved have a total land area of over 8300 km2 and extend for more than 500 km from north to south. \n\nLord of Islay was a thirteenth- and fourteenth-century title borne by the chiefs of Clann Domhnaill before they assumed the title \"Lord of the Isles\" in the late fourteenth century.  The first person regarded to have styled themself \"Lord of Islay\" is Aonghus M\u00f3r, son of the eponymous ancestor of the clan, Domhnall mac Raghnaill.  The designation \"of Islay\" was frequently used by these lords and later members of the clan. \n\nJaluit Atoll (Marshallese: J\u0101lw\u014dj , , or J\u0101looj , ) is a large coral atoll of 91 islands in the Pacific Ocean and forms a legislative district of the Ralik Chain of the Marshall Islands.  Its total land area is 11.34 km2 , and it encloses a lagoon with an area of 690 km2 .  Most of the land area is on the largest islet (motu) of Jaluit (10.4\u00a0km\u00b2).  Jaluit is approximately 220 km southwest of Majuro.  Jaluit Atoll is a designated conservation area and Ramsar Wetland. \n\nNational parks of Taiwan are protected spaces for their nature, wildlife, and history in its current jurisdiction.  Currently there are nine national parks in Taiwan, all are under the administration of the Ministry of the Interior.  These national parks covers 7489.49 km2 .  The 3103.76 km2 total land area constitutes around 8.6% of the entire land area of the country. \n\nForests in Himachal Pradesh currently cover an area of nearly 37,691 sqkm , which is about 38.3% of the total land area of the state.  The forests were once considered to be the main source of income of the state and most of the original forests were clear felled.  The emphasis has shifted, however, from exploitation to conservation.  The state government aims to increase forest cover to 50% of the total land area.  There have been various projects, including the establishment of protected areas such as National Parks, designed to preserve and expand the forests. \n\n",

        "context": "Azra was a rock band that was popular across Yugoslavia in the 1980s.  Azra was formed in 1977 by its frontman Branimir \"Johnny\" \u0160tuli\u0107.  The other two members of the original line-up were Mi\u0161o Hrnjak (bass) and Boris Leiner (drums).  The band is named after a verse from \"Der Asra\" by Heinrich Heine.  They are considered to be one of the most influential bands from the former Yugoslav new wave rock era and the Yugoslav rock scene in general. \n\nCargo Records was a Canadian independent record label and distributor, active in the 1980s and 1990s.  Based in Montreal, the company both released albums directly as a label, and distributed albums on behalf of many other small independent labels, making it one of the largest and most influential Canadian record companies of the alternative rock era. \n\nAdam and the Ants were an English rock band active during the late 1970s and early 1980s.  The group, which lasted from 1977 to 1982, existed in two incarnations, both fronted by Adam Ant.  The first, founded in May 1977 and known simply as The Ants until November that year, achieved considerable cult popularity during the transition from the punk rock era to the post-punk and new wave era and were noted for their high camp and overtly sexualised stage performances and songs.  The final line-up of this first incarnation \u2013 Dave Barbarossa, Matthew Ashman and Leigh Gorman \u2013 left the band in January 1980 at the suggestion of then-de facto manager Malcolm McLaren, to form the instrumentalist personnel of the controversial Bow Wow Wow. \n\nThe Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961.  The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson; their cousin Mike Love; and their friend Al Jardine.  Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era.  The group, led by their principal songwriter and producer Brian, pioneered novel approaches to popular music form and production, combining their affinities for jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&B to create their unique sound.  He later arranged his compositions for studio orchestras and explored a variety of other styles, often incorporating classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. \n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960.  With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era.  Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways.  In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", and as the group's music grew in sophistication in subsequent years, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. \n\nMarsha Albert (born 1948) is credited with being the person who jump-started the early 1960s phenomena known as Beatlemania in the United States when as a 15-year-old girl, on 17 December 1963, she introduced for the first time on American radio a song written and recorded by The Beatles titled I Want to Hold Your Hand (the Beatles' best-selling single worldwide), and that Beatles historian and author Bruce Spizer noted, in 2004, by his stating \"Marsha Albert's actions forced a major record company to push up the release date of a debut single from an unknown band during the holiday season, a time when record companies traditionally released no new product.\" \n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960.  With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era.  In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. \n\nElvis Presley has inspired artistic and cultural works since he entered the national consciousness.  From that point, interest in his personal and public life has never stopped.  Some scholars have even studied many aspects of his profound cultural influence. \" Billboard\" historian Joel Whitburn declared Presley the \"#1 act of the Rock era\". \n\nDavid \"Bruce\" Spizer (born July 2, 1955) is a tax attorney in New Orleans, Louisiana, who is also recognized as an expert on The Beatles.  He has published eight books, and is frequently quoted as an authority on the history of the band and its recordings. \n\nChristian Death is an American deathrock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1979 by Rozz Williams.  They became a highly influential act, heralding the American gothic rock and deathrock movements. \n\n",

In , the team changed its official name to the Washington Nationals.  The name \"Nationals\" appeared on the uniforms for only two seasons, and was then replaced with the \"W\" logo for the next 52 years.  However, the names \"Senators\", \"Nationals\" and shorter \"Nats\" were used interchangeably by fans and media for the next sixty years; in , the latter two names were revived for the current National League franchise that had previously played in Montreal.  For a time, from 1911 to 1933, the Senators were one of the more successful franchises in Major League Baseball.  The team's rosters included Baseball Hall of Fame members Goose Goslin, Sam Rice, Joe Cronin, Bucky Harris, Heinie Manush and one of the greatest players and pitchers of all time, Walter Johnson.  But the Senators are remembered more for their many years of mediocrity and futility, including six last-place finishes in the 1940s and 1950s.  Joe Judge, Cecil Travis, Buddy Myer, Roy Sievers and Eddie Yost were other notable Senators players whose careers were spent in obscurity due to the team's lack of success. \n\nThe Baltimore Orioles are an American professional baseball team based in Baltimore, Maryland.

After 52 often-beleaguered years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney/civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. The team's current majority owner is lawyer Peter Angelos. \n\nThe Boston Red Sox are an American professional baseball team based in Boston, Massachusetts.  The Red Sox compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division.  The Red Sox have won eight World Series championships and have played in twelve.

Taylor, around 1908 , following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the \"Boston Red Stockings\", including the forerunner of the Atlanta Braves. \n\nThe Atlanta Braves are a professional baseball team based in Atlanta, Georgia.  The Braves are members of the National League (NL) East division in Major League Baseball (MLB).  Since the franchise started as the Boston Red Stockings (no relationship to the current Boston Red Sox team) in 1871, the team has changed its name several times and relocated twice.  The Braves were a charter member of the NL in 1876 as the Boston Red Caps, and are one of the NL's two remaining charter franchises (the other being the Chicago Cubs).  In baseball, the head coach of a team is called the manager, or more formally, the field manager.  The duties of the team manager include team strategy and leadership on and off the field.  The Braves franchise has employed 45 managers. \n\nThe Detroit Tigers are a professional baseball team based in Detroit, Michigan.  The Tigers are members of the American League Central Division in Major League Baseball.  In baseball, the head coach of a team is called the manager, or more formally, the field manager.  The duties of the team manager include team strategy and leadership on and off the field.  The team initially began in the now defunct Western League in 1894, and later became one of the American League's eight charter franchises in 1901.  Since the inception of the team in 1894, it has employed 46 different managers.  The Tigers current manager is Brad Ausmus, who was hired for the 2014 season. \n\nMarcus Wayne Garland (born October 26, 1950) is a retired American right-handed pitcher who spent nine seasons from 1973 to 1981 in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Baltimore Orioles (1973\u20131976) and Cleveland Indians (1977\u20131981).  He was one of 24 ballplayers who profited from the advent of MLB free agency following the 1976 season.  A torn rotator cuff rendered his playing career into a cautionary tale of the risks of signing pitchers to free-agent contracts of seven years or longer.  The article outlined how Garland was constantly criticized by Cleveland's incompetent management for not living up to his contract (even though his decline in performance was entirely due to a serious arm injury that could not be fixed effectively by mid-1970's sports medicine) and had fans savagely booing him and even vandalizing his car during games. \n\nThe Cleveland Indians are a professional baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio.  They are in the Central Division of Major League Baseball's American League.  Since 1994, they have played in Progressive Field.  The Cleveland team originated in 1900 as the Lake Shores, when the American League (AL) was officially a minor league.  One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the major league incarnation of the club was founded in Cleveland in 1901. \n\nThe Guelph Royals are a baseball team based in the downtown area of Guelph, Ontario, and are a member of the Southern Ontario-based Intercounty Baseball League.  The Royals are an iconic symbol of Guelph pride.  The club was founded in 1861 as the Guelph Maple Leafs, and after winning the \"Canadian Silver Ball Championship\" three times between 1869 and 1872, went on to become world semi-professional champions in 1874, and hold brief membership in the International Association for Professional Base Ball Players during the 1877 season, rivalling National League teams.  In 1919, they joined the Intercounty Baseball League, and underwent a series of name changes (the Guelph-Waterloo Royals in 1954; the Guelph Plymouths in 1957; the Guelph Merchants in 1958; the Guelph Royals in 1962; the Guelph CJOYs in 1964) before being officially renamed the \"Royals\".  From 1861 to 1925, the team divided its home games between various ballparks in the city, before the construction of a stadium in Exhibition Park led them to permanently play there.  In 1986, they moved into a new stadium, David E. Hastings Stadium, also in Exhibition Park.  In spite of only winning one Intercounty championship between 1932 and 1993, the team has done well in recent years, winning four since.  They currently hold nine Intercounty championships, behind the Kitchener Panthers, with 12, and the Brantford Red Sox, with 10, and are one of only two remaining charter franchises in the league, along with the Kitchener Panthers. \n\nThe Minnesota Twins are an American professional baseball team based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and play in the Central Division of Major League Baseball's American League.  The team is named after the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota.  One of the American League's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Kansas City, Kansas in 1894 as the Kansas City Blues before moving to Washington, D.C. and renamed Senators.  In 1905 the team changed its official name to the Washington Nationals.  The name \"Nationals\" would appear on the uniforms for only 2 seasons, and would then be replaced with the \"W\" logo for the next 52 years.  The media often shortened the nickname to \"Nats\".  Many fans and newspapers (especially out-of-town papers) persisted in using the \"Senators\" nickname.  Over time, \"Nationals\" faded as a nickname, and \"Senators\" became dominant.  Baseball guides would list the club's nickname as \"Nationals or Senators\", acknowledging the dual-nickname situation.  In 1961, the Senators relocated to Minnesota and were renamed the Twins. \n\nThe Detroit Tigers are an American professional baseball team based in Detroit, Michigan.  The Tigers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division.  One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Detroit in 1901 .  They are the oldest continuous one-name, one-city franchise in the AL The Tigers have won four World Series championships (, , , and ), 11 AL pennants (1907, 1908, 1909, 1934, 1935, 1940, 1945, 1968, 1984, 2006, 2012), and four AL Central division championships (2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014).  The Tigers also won division titles in 1972, 1984 and 1987 while members of the AL East.  The team currently plays its home games at Comerica Park in Downtown Detroit. \n\n",

        "context": "Antoine Quinquet was a French pharmacist who was born in Soissons on 9 March 1745.  In 1760 he was apprenticed to an apothecary in Soissons and in 1777 he moved to Paris where he worked for Antoine Baum\u00e9.  He travelled to Geneva, where he met Aim\u00e9 Argand.  In 1779, he returned to Paris and opened his own pharmacy there. \n\nA trouble light, also known as a rough service light, drop light, or inspection lamp, is a special lamp used to illuminate obscure places and able to handle moderate abuse.  The light bulb is housed in a protective cage and a handle that are molded to form a single unit.  It has a long power line for distant reaching; the handle may also have electrical outlet on it, allowing the light to also double as an extension cord. \n\nThe Lewis lamp is a type of light fixture used in lighthouses.  It was invented by Winslow Lewis who patented the design in 1810.  The primary marketing point of the Lewis lamp was that it used less than half the oil of the prior oil lamps which they replaced.  The lamp used a similar design to an Argand lamp, adding a parabolic reflector behind the lamp and a magnifying lens made from 4 in green bottle glass in front of the lamp.  A similar variant using a parabolic reflector was created by the inventor of the Argand lamp, Aim\u00e9 Argand.  While the Argand variant became widely used by European lighthouses, the Lewis lamp design was selected by the United States for use in American lighthouses. \n\nThe qulliq (seal-oil, blubber or soapstone lamp, Inuktitut: \u1581\u14ea\u14d5\u1585 , \u2018\"kudlik\"\u2019 ] ; Inupiaq: \"naniq\" ), is the traditional oil lamp used by Arctic peoples, including the Inuit, the Chukchi and the Yupik peoples. \n\nThe Hefner lamp, or in German Hefnerkerze, is a flame lamp used in photometry that burns amyl acetate. \n\nThe Argand lamp, a kind of oil lamp, was invented and patented in 1780 by Aim\u00e9 Argand.  Its output is 6 to 10 candela, brighter than that of earlier lamps.  Its more complete combustion of the candle wick and oil than in other lamps required much less frequent trimming of the wick. \n\nA glow switch starter is a type of preheat starter used with fluorescent lamp.  It is commonly filled with neon gas or argon gas and contains a bimetallic strip and a stationary electrode.  The operating principle is simple, when current is applied, the gas inside ionizes and heats a bimetallic strip which in turn bends toward the stationary electrode thus shorting the starter between the electrodes of the fluorescent lamp After a second the starter's bimetallic strip will cool and open the circuit between the electrodes and the process repeats until the lamp has lit.  One disadvantage of glow switch starters is that when the lamp is at the end of its life it will continuously blink on and off until the glow switch starter wears out or an electrode on the fluorescent lamp burns out. \n\nThe carbon button lamp is a single-electrode incandescent lamp invented by Nikola Tesla.  A carbon button lamp contains a small carbon sphere positioned in the center of an evacuated glass bulb.  This type of lamp must be driven by high-frequency alternating current, and depends on an electric arc or perhaps a vacuum arc to produce high current around the carbon electrode.  The carbon electrode is then heated to incandescence by collisions by ions which constitute the electric current.  Tesla found that these lamps could be used as powerful sources of ionizing radiation. \n\nA kerosene lamp (usually called a paraffin lamp in some countries) is a type of lighting device that uses kerosene (paraffin) as a fuel.  Kerosene lamps have a wick or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held lanterns may be used for portable lighting.  Like oil lamps, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without rural electrification, in electrified areas during power outages, at campsites, and on boats.  There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat wick, central draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp.  Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead flame, hot blast, and cold blast variants. \n\nA hollow-cathode lamp (HCL) is type of cold cathode lamp used in physics and chemistry as a spectral line source (e.g. for atomic absorption spectrometers) and as a frequency tuner for light sources such as lasers.  An HCL takes advantage of the hollow cathode effect, which causes conduction at a lower voltage and with more current than a cold cathode lamp that does not have a hollow cathode. \n\n",

        "context": "Otaara, abbreviated Otr.  in the horticultural trade, is an intergeneric hybrid of orchids, with \"Brassavola\", \"Broughtonia\", \"Cattleya\", \"Laelia\" and \"Sophronitis\" as parent genera. \n\nWilliam Henry Nicholls (23 July 1885 \u2013 10 March 1951) was an Australian amateur botanist, authority on, and collector of Australian orchids.  An accomplished photographer and watercolourist, he contributed almost 100 articles on orchids to \"The Victorian Naturalist\", many of which described new species with line drawings.  He was working on producing a 24-volume illustrated monograph of all the orchids of Australia when he died.  Only four volumes were published shortly after his death but the entire work was published in a single book, \"Orchids of Australia\" in 1969.  Some of the many orchids described and named by Nicholls and retaining the name he gave them include \"Caladenia caudata\", \"Caladenia echidnachila\", \"Caladenia ensata\", \"Caladenia ferruginea\", \"Caladenia magniclavata\", \"Caladenia ornata\", \"Caladenia praecox\", \"Caladenia radiata\", \"Pterostylis fischii\", \"Pterostylis hamiltonii\", \"Pterostylis hildii\" and \"Pterostylis tenuissima\". \n\nParacaleana commonly known as duck orchids, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae that is found in Australia and New Zealand.  The Australian species are found in all states but have not been recorded in the Northern Territory.  Orchids in this genus are similar to \"Caleana major\", but there are differences in the flowers and in the insects that pollinate them.  \"Paraceleana\" orchids, as well as hammer orchids (\"Drakaea\") are pollinated by male thynnid wasps.  Duck orchids have a single leaf and one or a few, dull-coloured, inconspicuous flowers. \n\nCaladenia, commonly known as spider orchids, is a genus of 350 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Spider orchids are terrestrial herbs with a single hairy leaf and a hairy stem.  The labellum is fringed or toothed in most species and there are small projections called calli on the labellum.  The flowers have adaptations to attract particular species of insects for pollination.  The genus is divided into three groups on the basis of flower shape, broadly, spider orchids, zebra orchids and cowslip orchids, although other common names are often used.  Although they occur in other countries, most are Australian and 136 species occur in Western Australia, making it the most species-rich orchid genus in that state. \n\nBroughtonia sanguinea, also known as Blood Red Broughtonia is a plant in the genus \"Broughtonia\", a member of the Orchidaceae family.  The genus is abbreviated Bro in trade journals. \n\nBroughtonia is a genus of orchids (family Orchidaceae) native to the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles.  The genus is abbreviated Bro in trade journals. \n\nCalochilus, commonly known as beard orchids, is a genus of about 30 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Beard orchids are terrestrial, herbs with a single leaf at the base of the plant, or no leaves.  Their most striking feature is a densely hairy labellum, giving rise to their common name.  Beard orchids, unlike some other Australian orchids, do not reproduce using daughter tubers, but self-pollinate when cross-pollination has not occurred.  Most species occur in Australia but some are found in New Zealand, New Guinea and New Caledonia. \n\nLady's slipper orchids (also known as lady slipper orchids or slipper orchids) are orchids in the subfamily Cypripedioideae, which comprises the genera \"Cypripedium, Mexipedium, Paphiopedilum, Phragmipedium\" and \"Selenipedium\".  They are characterised by the slipper-shaped pouches (modified labellums) of the flowers \u2013 the pouch traps insects so they are forced to climb up past the staminode, behind which they collect or deposit pollinia, thus fertilizing the flower. \n\nHawkinsara, abbreviated Hknsa.  in the horticultural trade, is an intergeneric hybrid of orchids, with parent genera \"Broughtonia\", \"Cattleya\", \"Laelia\" and \"Sophronitis\". \n\nCattleytonia (from \"Cattleya\" and \"Broughtonia\", its parental genera) is an intergeneric hybrid of orchids.  It is abbreviated Ctna in horticultural trade. \n\n",

        "context": "The Tertiary Student Rugby League World Cup, also known as the University Rugby League World Cup, first took place in 1986 in New Zealand, when the then five test nations each entered a side in what was the first non-first grade World Cup hosted by the Rugby League International Federation. \n\nThe 1991 Rugby World Cup was the second edition of the Rugby World Cup, and was jointly hosted by England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and France; at that time, the five European countries that participated in the Five Nations Championship making it the first Rugby World Cup to be staged in the northern hemisphere, with England as the host of the championship game.  Following on from the success of the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup, the 1991 World Cup received increased attention and was seen as a major global sporting event for the first time.  Also for the first time qualifying competitions were introduced as the number of entrants had increased from 16 nations four years before to a total of 33 countries, the eight quarter-finalists from 1987 qualified automatically with the remaining 25 countries having to qualify for the remaining eight spots.  This however resulted in only one new side qualifying for the tournament, Western Samoa replacing Tonga.  The same 16-team pool/knock-out format was used with just minor changes to the points system. \n\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup was the 17th staging of the FIFA World Cup which took place from 31 May to 30 June 2002 in South Korea and Japan.  It was the first World Cup to be held in Asia, the first to be held on a continent other than Europe or the Americas, the last World Cup during which the golden goal rule was in force and the only World Cup to be jointly hosted by more than one nation.  Brazil won the tournament for a record fifth time, winning the final against Germany 2\u20130.  The victory meant Brazil qualified for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup for the fifth time, representing the World.  In the third place play-off match against South Korea, Turkey won 3\u20132 taking third place in only their second ever FIFA World Cup finals.  China PR, Ecuador, Senegal and Slovenia made their first appearances at the finals with Turkey making its first appearance since 1954.  Republic of Ireland, Russia and Sweden returned after missing the 1998 tournament. \n\nThe 1968\u20131969 season was the 66th season of competitive football in Belgium.  Standard Club Li\u00e9geois won their 4th Division I title.  No Belgian club managed to pass the second round of the European competitions, though for the first time 6 Belgian clubs qualified (1 more club qualified for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup).  K Lierse SK won the Belgian Cup final against RR White (2-0).  The Belgium national football team continued their 1970 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with 3 home wins against all other Group 6 teams (Finland, Yugoslavia and Spain) and a draw in Spain.  Belgium qualified for the 1970 FIFA World Cup finals in Mexico with one match to go.  For the first time since the 1954 FIFA World Cup, Belgium would qualify for a major tournament. \n\nOrvar Bergmark (16 November 1930 \u2013 10 May 2004) was a Swedish football defender and manager.  He was the second Swedish national manager ever, and managed to qualify the Swedish national football team for the FIFA World Cup in Mexico 1970, after having beaten France (among others) in the qualifications.  The 1970 World Cup was the first one in 12 years, and it was also the first time in 20 years that Sweden had \"qualified\" for a World Cup.  (Sweden hosted the 1958 FIFA World Cup, and hence did not need to qualify.)  Sweden did not qualify for the World Cups in 1954, 1962 and 1966). \n\nThe Ukraine's National Football Team (Ukrainian: \u0417\u0431\u0456\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0437 \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0443 ) is the national football team of Ukraine and is controlled by the Football Federation of Ukraine.  After Ukrainian Independence and the country's breakaway from the Soviet Union, they played their first match against Hungary on 29 April 1992.  The team's biggest success on the world stage was reaching the quarter-finals in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which also marked the team's debut in the finals of a major championship.  As the host nation, Ukraine automatically qualified for UEFA Euro 2012.  Four years later, Ukraine qualified for Euro 2016 via the play-off route, the first time qualifying for a UEFA European Championship via the qualifying process, as it finished in third place in its qualifying group.  This marked the first time in Ukraine's five play-off appearances that it managed to win such a tie, previously unsuccessful in the play-off ties for the Euro 2000, 2002 World Cup, 2010 World Cup and 2014 World Cup. \n\nAlgeria have appeared in the finals of the FIFA World Cup on four occasions in 1982, 1986, 2010 and 2014.  They have once qualified for the knockout rounds, reaching the round of 16 in 2014 before losing to Germany.  32 years before, Algeria nearly qualified to the second round of the 1982 World Cup after beating both West Germany and Chile; however, an arrangement match between West Germany and Austria wound up eliminating the Algerians.  In 2014, Algeria qualifyed for the first time into the round of 16. \n\nThe Switzerland women's national football team represents Switzerland in international women's football.  The team played its first match in 1972.  Their most recent competition is qualification for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, and they had qualified as the best team in their group.  It would be the first time that Switzerland participated in a women's World Cup, and the first time both the men's team and women's team qualified for a World Cup simultaneously.  Switzerland qualified for the European Championship for the first time in 2017.  They have never qualified for the Olympic games. \n\nThe 2014 ICC World Cup Qualifier was a cricket tournament to decide the final qualification for the 2015 World Cup.  The top two teams qualified for the World Cup joining Ireland and for the first time Afghanistan who have already qualified through the 2011\u201313 ICC World Cricket League Championship and maintained their ODI status.  The World Cup Qualifier was the final event of the 2009\u201314 World Cricket League.  It was staged in New Zealand, from 13 January to 1 February 2014 after Scotland relinquished the right to host it. \n\nThe opening ceremonies of the 2015 Cricket World Cup took place in New Zealand and Australia on the eve of the beginning of the World Cup hosted by them after 23 years.  Two ceremonies took place at the same time, one in North Hagley Park, Christchurch in New Zealand while the other in Melbourne, Australia.  Thousands of fans turned up to watch the opening ceremony in both locations.  It was the first major sporting event hosted by Christchurch after the deadly 2011 Christchurch earthquake. \n\n",

        "context": "The Northern Virginia Campaign, also known as the Second Bull Run Campaign or Second Manassas Campaign, was a series of battles fought in Virginia during August and September 1862 in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War.  Confederate General Robert E. Lee followed up his successes of the Seven Days Battles in the Peninsula Campaign by moving north toward Washington, D.C., and defeating Maj. Gen. John Pope and his Army of Virginia. \n\nThe Battle of Cross Keys was fought on June 8, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia, as part of Confederate Army Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.  Together, the battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic the following day were the decisive victories in Jackson's Valley Campaign, forcing the Union armies to retreat and leaving Jackson free to reinforce Gen. Robert E. Lee for the Seven Days Battles outside Richmond, Virginia. \n\nThe Battle of Malvern Hill, also known as the Battle of Poindexter's Farm, was fought on July 1, 1862 between the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, led by Gen. Robert E. Lee, and the Union Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan.  It was the final battle of the Seven Days Battles during the American Civil War, taking place on a 130 ft elevation of land known as Malvern Hill, near the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia and just one mile (1.6\u00a0km) from the James River.  Including inactive reserves, more than fifty thousand soldiers from each side took part, using more than two hundred pieces of artillery and three warships. \n\nThe Battle of Port Republic was fought on June 9, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia, as part of Confederate Army Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.  Port Republic was a fierce contest between two equally determined foes and was the most costly battle fought by Jackson's Army of the Valley during its campaign.  Together, the battles of Cross Keys (fought the previous day) and Port Republic were the decisive victories in Jackson's Valley Campaign, forcing the Union armies to retreat and leaving Jackson free to reinforce Gen. Robert E. Lee for the Seven Days Battles outside Richmond, Virginia. \n\nSavage's Station was the wartime name of a supply depot, ammunition dump, field hospital, and command headquarters of the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War.  Savage's Station was located in Henrico County, Virginia on what was the Richmond and York River Railroad, however the historical department of the Norfolk Southern Railroad, the railroad track's current owner, has no record that an actual train station or station house ever existed on the property.  A farmhouse is known to have been located in a copse of trees on a small knoll next to the railroad track and is visible in several period drawings and photographs made during the war.  The house served as the nucleus of a large field hospital during and after the battle of Seven Pines and the Seven Days Battles.  The house also functioned as General George B. McClellan's headquarters during the battle of Savage's Station on June 29, 1862.  Although the house survived the battle in 1862, it was burned by Federal cavalry under General Philip H. Sheridan in 1864.  The house appears to have never been rebuilt, and no trace of it remains today.  However, a smokehouse from the 19th century still existed on the property as late as the 1930s when it was photographed during a survey of local historical structures as a project of the Civilian Conservation Corps.  The smokehouse fell into ruin and collapsed sometime prior to the 1980s.  A small brick-walled cemetery from the 18th century still sits near the former location of the house not far from the railroad track. \n\nWilliam Dorsey Pender (February 6, 1834 \u2013 July 18, 1863) was a General in the Confederacy in the American Civil War serving as a Brigade and Divisional commander.  Promoted to brigadier on the battlefield at Seven Pines by Confederate President Jefferson Davis in person, he fought in the Seven Days Battles and at Second Manassas, Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, being wounded in each of these engagements.  Lee rated him as one of the most promising of his commanders, promoting him to major general at twenty-nine.  Pender was mortally wounded on the second day of Gettysburg. \n\nThe following Union Army units and commanders fought in the Seven Days Battles (from June 25 to July 1, 1862) of the American Civil War.  Order of battle compiled from the army organization-return of casualties during the battle and the reports.  The Confederate order of battle is listed separately. \n\nThe Seven Days Battles were a series of six major battles over the seven days from June 25 to July 1, 1862, near Richmond, Virginia, during the American Civil War.  Confederate General Robert E. Lee drove the invading Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, away from Richmond and into a retreat down the Virginia Peninsula.  The series of battles is sometimes known erroneously as the Seven Days Campaign, but it was actually the culmination of the Peninsula Campaign, not a separate campaign in its own right. \n\nThe following Confederate States Army units and commanders fought in the Seven Days Battles (from June 25 to July 1, 1862) of the American Civil War.  Order of battle compiled from the army organization during the battle, the casualty returns and the reports.  The Union order of battle is listed separately. \n\nThe Battle of Gaines's Mill, sometimes known as the First Battle of Cold Harbor or the Battle of Chickahominy River, took place on June 27, 1862, in Hanover County, Virginia, as the third of the Seven Days Battles (Peninsula Campaign) of the American Civil War.  Following the inconclusive Battle of Beaver Dam Creek (Mechanicsville) the previous day, Confederate General Robert E. Lee renewed his attacks against the right flank of the Union Army, relatively isolated on the northern side of the Chickahominy River.  There, Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps had established a strong defensive line behind Boatswain's Swamp.  Lee's force was destined to launch the largest Confederate attack of the war, about 57,000 men in six divisions.  Porter's reinforced V Corps held fast for the afternoon as the Confederates attacked in a disjointed manner, first with the division of Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill, then Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, suffering heavy casualties.  The arrival of Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's command was delayed, preventing the full concentration of Confederate force before Porter received some reinforcements from the VI Corps. \n\n",

This is a great struggle throughout Georgia because of opposition from the high school's football coaches and athletic directors.  The club plays the most common version of rugby, called rugby union but often just referred to as rugby.  Although the club plays by rugby union rules, they also play by the rules of the International Rugby Board (IRB) for those under 19 years of age.  In the summer of 2011, the Trojan Rugby Football Club took part in another version of rugby called rugby sevens.  This variation of rugby is faster paced, with the same size fields but fewer people, and shorter half lengths. \n\nTrafford Bar is a tram stop on Greater Manchester's light rail system, Metrolink, at the junction of Talbot Road and Seymour Grove in Old Trafford.  It opened on 15 June 1992 as part of Phase 1 of Metrolink's expansion, before which it was a railway station. \n\nAquinas Old Collegians Football Club, nicknamed the Bloods, is an amateur Australian rules football club in Ringwood, Victoria, playing in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA).  Previously called Aquinas Old Boys Football Club when it was founded in 1981, the club plays at Aquinas College.  The club song is \"We're a team of Champions\", to the tune of \"Join in the Chorus\" . \n\nMaxine's Tap Room is a historic bar in Fayetteville, Arkansas, located on 107 N. Block Ave. It is one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas.  Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar in 1950 when she was 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents.  She managed to pay her parents back within the year.  In 1960 she tore down the old wooden building in which the bar had been located and had the current building\u2014a long, narrow brick structure\u2014built in its place.  The new building had only one window, exactly 8.5 in by 40 in , in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time.  This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins.  Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success.  Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a 50 ft -long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie.  Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000.  She died at age 82 in May 2006.  A month later the Tap Room caught fire.  Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007.  Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar.  The exposed rafters darkened by the fire were simply painted black, and a skylight was installed where the roof had burned through.  Considerable efforts were made to retain many things that had been in the bar for a very long time, such as the older lights and signs. \n\nManchester United Football Club is an English professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester.

        "context": "Mary Poppins is a 1964 American musical-fantasy film directed by Robert Stevenson and produced by Walt Disney, with songs written and composed by the Sherman Brothers.  The screenplay is by Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi, loosely based on P. L. Travers' book series \"Mary Poppins\".  The film, which combines live-action and animation, stars Julie Andrews in the role of Mary Poppins who visits a dysfunctional family in London and employs her unique brand of lifestyle to improve the family's dynamic.  Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, and Glynis Johns are featured in supporting roles.  The film was shot entirely at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California using painted London background scenes. \n\n\"Mary Poppins\" is a song from the 2015 stage musical \"Love Birds\" with music and lyrics by Robert J. Sherman.  It is sung by \"The Original Quack Pack\", a penguin barbershop quartet who resemble the penguins from the 1964 Walt Disney motion picture, \"Mary Poppins\".  In dialogue leading up to the song, the penguins explain that while they did know the same nanny, (Mary Poppins) they are not the same penguins as in the movie.  The song expresses their longing for the magical nanny of literary fame. \n\n\"My Kind of Town\" or \"My Kind of Town (Chicago Is)\" is a popular song composed by Jimmy Van Heusen, with lyrics by Sammy Cahn.  It was originally part of the musical score for \"Robin and the 7 Hoods\", a 1964 musical film starring several members of the Rat Pack.  It was nominated for the 1964 Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost to \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\" from \"Mary Poppins\".  Although the song predated the Grammy Award Best Original Song for a Motion Picture category, the entire score was nominated for the 1964 Grammy Award in the category Best Original Score Written for A Motion Picture, but it lost to the eponymously titled \"Mary Poppins\" score. \n\n\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\" is a song from \"Mary Poppins\", the 1964 musical motion picture.  It was originally sung by Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, and also is featured in the Cameron Mackintosh/Disney \"Mary Poppins\" musical.  The song can be heard in the \"Mary Poppins\" scene of The Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios and during the \"Mary Poppins\" segment of \"\" at Disneyland. \n\nMary Poppins Returns (also known as Mary Poppins 2) is an upcoming American musical fantasy film directed by Rob Marshall and written by David Magee.  It is the sequel to the 1964 film \"Mary Poppins\".  The film stars Emily Blunt, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer, Pixie Davies, Joel Dawson, Nathanael Saleh, Julie Walters, Colin Firth, Dick Van Dyke and Meryl Streep.  Set 25 years after the 1964 film, it will feature Mary Poppins, the former nanny of Jane and Michael Banks, re-visiting them after a family tragedy.  The film is scheduled for release on December 25, 2018, giving it one of the longest gaps between film sequels in history. \n\nMary Poppins Opens the Door is a British children's fantasy novel by the Australian-British writer P.L. Travers, the third book and last novel in the \"Mary Poppins\" series that features the magical English nanny Mary Poppins.  It was published in 1943 by Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc and illustrated by Mary Shepard and Agnes Sims. \n\n\"I Love to Laugh\", also called \"We Love to Laugh\", is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\".  It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The song is sung in the film by \"Uncle Albert\" (Ed Wynn), and \"Bert\" (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself.  The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can \"lighten\" a mood.  (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.)  Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors \"down to earth\" again.  The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well. \n\n\"A Man Has Dreams\" is a song from Walt Disney's film \"Mary Poppins\", written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The song melody is a slowed down version of \"The Life I Lead\" which serves as Banks's leitmotif as he was fired.  In both the motion picture and the stage musical, the song is performed as a conversational duet between Bert, the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke) and George Banks (David Tomlinson).  It is operatic in nature, sung dialogue, and was highly unusual for a musical film of that era.  The song incorporates a reprise of \"A Spoonful of Sugar\" which is Mary Poppins's leitmotif. \n\n\"Step In Time\" is a song and dance number from Walt Disney's 1964 film \"Mary Poppins\", and it is composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The choreography for this song was provided by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood.  It is sung by Bert, the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke) and the other chimney sweeps on the rooftops of London.  In the first part of the song, the lines he says in the verses are \"Kick your knees up\", \"'Round the chimney\", \"Flap like a birdie\", \"Up on the railing\", \"Over the rooftops\" and \"Link your elbows\" followed by an interlude.  The interlude continues with Bert, Mary Poppins, Michael, Jane and all the chimney sweepers dancing around the rooftops and as Admiral Boom looks at them with the telescope, he thinks that they're Hottentots, so he orders Mr. Binnacle to make them scram with colorful fireworks.  In the second part, as all the chimney sweepers get in the house of George Banks, Mrs. Brill walks into the living room looking at them and screams, \"They're at it again!\"  and she runs away trying to strike one of the chimney sweepers with a frying pan.  As Jane, Michael, Mary Poppins and Bert get in the same place, Ellen runs around the dining room with an \"OW!\"  and the chimney sweepers flip her.  The other phrases in the rest of the musical number are \"Votes for women,\" \"It's the master,\" and \"What's all this?\" \n\nMary Poppins, Goodbye (Russian: \u041c\u044d\u0440\u0438 \u041f\u043e\u043f\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0441, \u0434\u043e \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f!  ; translit. \u00a0\"Meri Poppins, do svidaniya\") is a Soviet 1983 two-part musical miniseries (part 1 \"Lady Perfection\", part 2 \"Week ends on Wednesday\"), directed by Leonid Kvinikhidze.  It is loosely based on Mary Poppins stories by P. L. Travers.  The TV series were ordered by the Gosteleradio of USSR and produced by Mosfilm.  The official television premiere was on January 8, 1984. \n\n",

        "context": "The Korea 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was the second official bid from the Korea Football Association or the KFA.  If this bid was successful, Korea would have been hosting their second World Cup Finals and it would have been their first solo hosting since they shared the 2002 FIFA World Cup with other co-host Japan.  Despite recent tensions, Han Sung-joo, chairman of the bid committee hoped to involve North Korea if South Korea received the bid. \n\nThe bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups was the process by which the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) selected locations for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups.  The process began officially in March 2009; eleven bids from thirteen countries were received, including one which was withdrawn and one that was rejected before FIFA's executive committee voted in November 2010.  Two of the remaining nine bids applied only to the 2022 World Cup, while the rest were initially applications for both.  Over the course of the bidding, all non-European bids for the 2018 event were withdrawn, resulting in the exclusion of all European bids from consideration for the 2022 edition.  By the time of the decision, bids for the 2018 World Cup included England, Russia, a joint bid from Belgium and Netherlands, and a joint bid from Portugal and Spain.  Bids for the 2022 World Cup came from Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States.  Indonesia's bid was disqualified due to lack of governmental support, and Mexico withdrew its bid for financial reasons. \n\nThe Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was a bid by Qatar to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.  The bid has come under FBI investigation for bribery and corruption, leading to the resignation of FIFA President Sepp Blatter.  With a population of 2 million people, Qatar will be the first Arab state to host the World Cup. \n\nRussia announced its intent to bid for the FIFA World Cup in early 2009, and submitted its request to FIFA in time.  Russia's President Vladimir Putin has taken a keen interest in the bid and has gone so far as ordering Vitaly Mutko, the Minister of Sports, to \"prepare a bid for Russia to hold the 2018 World Cup\".  According to a report earlier submitted by Vitaly Mutko, who also served that time as President of the Russian Football Union (RFU), the country is ready to spend some $10 billion on the tournament.  The bid committee also includes RFU CEO Alexey Sorokin and Alexander Djordjadze as the Director of Bid Planning and Operations.  In October 2010, Russia formally pulled out of the race to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.  On December 2, 2010 Russia was chosen as the host country for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. \n\nThe Indonesia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was the first official bid from the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) to host the FIFA World Cup.  FIFA rejected the bid for lack of government support on 19 March 2010.  Indonesia was one of four Asian countries bidding to bring the tournament to Asia for a second time, the 2002 tournament having been played in Japan and South Korea.  Indonesia, under the name of the Dutch East Indies, had been the first Asian nation to compete in the World Cup, when they participated in the 1938 event, and they lost to Hungary in the first round. \n\nThe Morocco 2026 FIFA World Cup bid is Morocco's bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup.  It is competing with the North America 2026 FIFA World Cup bid, a joint bid between Canada, Mexico and the United States for hosting rights.  On 11 August 2017, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation announced that it would submit a bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. \n\nThe Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid is the second official bid from the Japan Football Association or the JFA.  Had this bid been successful, Japan would have been hosting their second World Cup Finals and it would have been their first solo hosting since they shared the 2002 FIFA World Cup with other co-host South Korea, becoming the sixth nation to host the tournament twice, after Italy, France, Mexico, Brazil and (West) Germany.  On May 4, 2010, the Japanese Football Association Bid team decided to concentrate solely on winning the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. \n\nThe United States Soccer Federation submitted a bid with the hope of hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup.  U.S. Soccer first said in February 2007 that it would put forth a bid for the 2018 World Cup.  On January 28, 2009, U.S. Soccer announced that it would submit bids for both the 2018 and 2022 Cups.  In October 2010 it withdrew from the 2018 bid process to focus on winning the 2022 edition.  On December 2, 2010, it was announced that Qatar would be the host of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.  Bill Clinton remarked \"The FIFA people were in a mood to give it to people who didn\u2019t have it.  I think they wanted to make soccer a world sport.\" \n\nAustralia submitted an unsuccessful bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.  On 2 December 2010 FIFA announced that the event would be held in Qatar.  Australia also lodged a bid for the 2018 World Cup, but withdrew the bid on 10 June 2010.  The 2018 and 2022 World Cups will be the 21st and 22nd editions of the FIFA World Cup.  The bidding procedure to host both the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.  The bid was presented by Frank Lowy, Ben Buckley, Quentin Bryce and Elle Macpherson.  However, due to controversies of Qatar hosting, Australia's bid is possible if FIFA decides to strip Qatar's 2022 hosting rights. \n\nBonita Mersiades is an Australian corporate affairs practitioner, sports administrator and writer.  Until 24 January 2010, Mersiades was Head of Corporate and Public Affairs with the Football Federation Australia and was also a member of the Senior Management Team for the Australian 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bid. \n\n",

(CPACS) is 501(c)(3), private, nonprofit human services organization in metropolitan Atlanta, headquartered in northern DeKalb County, Georgia, United States of America.  The organization was founded in 1980 and provides broad services for American citizens and non-citizens of all race, ethnicity, and national origin.  The organization's primary services include community health, social services, housing, senior services, translation and interpretation, transportation services, education and enrichment programs for children, youth, and families, community education, legal and immigration assistance, counseling, advocacy, and research.  CPACS's core objective is to help immigrants and refugees achieve the American Dream.  The center operates the CPACS Cosmo Health Center, a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) that serves populations with limited access to health care.  Since 2005, the organization has held the Tea Walk, a two-mile empowerment walk along the Buford Highway Corridor to celebrate community diversity and promote civic engagement.  CPACS is a member of the Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO), which is part of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans.  CPACS is one of the first and largest Asian American and Pacific Islander human services agencies in the Southeastern United States. \n\nThe University of Florida Health Science Center (HSC), also known as the J. Hillis Miller Health Science Center, is the medical division of the University of Florida.  Its primary campuses are located on the university's main campus in Gainesville, Florida and at UF Health at Jacksonville in Jacksonville, Florida.  The Health Science Center comprises six colleges: Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Public Health and Health Professions, and Veterinary Medicine.  The Gainesville campus is the only academic health center in the United States with six health-related colleges located on a single, contiguous campus.  The facility was named after the fourth president of the University of Florida, J. Hillis Miller, Sr., who served from 1947 to 1953.  Miller spearheaded the effort to fund and build the university's College of Medicine and its teaching hospital, which were incorporated into the Health Science Center. \n\nThe Public Health Service Act of 1944 structured the United States Public Health Service (PHS), founded in 1798, as the primary division of the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW; which was established in 1953), which later became the United States Department of Health and Human Services in 1979\u20131980 (when the Education agencies were separated into their own U.S. Department of Education).  The Office of the Surgeon General was created in 1871.  The PHS comprises all Agency Divisions of Health and Human Services and the Commissioned Corps.  The Assistant Secretary for Health (ASH) oversees the PHS and the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. \n\nThe Supporting Healthy Marriage Project (SHM) is part of the Healthy Marriage Initiative funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, that was launched in 2003 as \"the first large-scale, multisite, multiyear, rigorous test of marriage education programs for low-income married couples\".  The project is motivated by research that \"indicates that married adults and children raised by both parents in stable, low-conflict households do better on a host of outcomes\".  The evaluation is led by MDRC, in collaboration with Abt Associates and other partners.  USASpending.gov reports payments of more than $30 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to MDRC for work on the Supporting Healthy Marriage Project from 2009 to 2012. \n\nNew Bolton Center is the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine\u2019s 700 acre campus in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania.  It is home to one of the busiest large animal teaching veterinary clinics in the nation.  Since 1958, it has been located at the former South Brook Farm.

        "context": "Oryctodromeus (meaning \"digging runner\") was a genus of small ornithopod dinosaur.  Fossils are known from the middle Cretaceous Blackleaf Formation of southwestern Montana and the Wayan Formation of southeastern Idaho, USA, both of the Cenomanian stage, roughly 95 million years ago.  A member of the small, presumably fast-running herbivorous family Thescelosauridae, \"Oryctodromeus\" is the first dinosaur published that shows evidence of burrowing behavior. \n\nDakotadon is a genus of iguanodont dinosaur from the Barremian-age Lower Cretaceous Lakota Formation of South Dakota, USA, known from a partial skull.  It was first described in 1989 as \"Iguanodon lakotaensis\", by David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork.  Its assignment has been controversial.  Some researchers suggest that \"\"I.\" lakotaensis\" was more basal than \"I. bernissartensis\", and related to \"Theiophytalia\", but David Norman has suggested that it was a synonym of \"I. bernissartensis\".  Gregory S. Paul, working on a revision of iguanodont species, gave \"I.\" \"lakotaensis\" its own genus (\"Dakotadon\") in 2008. \n\n\"Cinizasaurus\" is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a theropod dinosaur.  The remains, NMMNH P-18400, consist of a tibia, vertebrae, and fragments, and came from the ? late Carnian-age Upper Triassic Bluewater Creek Member of the Chinle Formation, near Fort Wingate.  Andrew Heckert, in his unpublished thesis, proposed the name \"Cinizasaurus hunti\" for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007).  In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauriformes. \n\nSupersaurus (meaning \"super lizard\") is a genus of diplodocid sauropod dinosaur first discovered by Vivian Jones of Delta, Colorado, in late Jurassic period rocks of the middle Morrison Formation of Colorado in 1972, and later in Portugal under the name \"S. lourinhanensis\".  The fossil remains came from the Brushy Basin Member of the formation, dating to about 153 million years ago. \n\nFruitadens is a genus of heterodontosaurid dinosaur.  The name means \"Fruita tooth\", in reference to Fruita, Colorado (USA), where its fossils were first found.  It is known from partial skulls and skeletons from at least four individuals of differing biological ages, found in Tithonian (Late Jurassic) rocks of the Morrison Formation in Colorado.  \"Fruitadens\" is the smallest known ornithischian dinosaur, with young adults estimated at 65 to in length and 0.5 to in weight.  It is interpreted as an omnivore and represents one of the latest-surviving heterodontosaurids. \n\nThe Compound is a 2008 young adult novel by S. A. Bodeen.  The book was first released on April 29, 2008 through Feiwel & Friends and centers upon a young boy named Eli who has been living in a compound for six years.  Bodeen came up with the idea of including cannibalism in the novel after watching a television show where \"a dinosaur fed a favorite offspring the bodies of its less fortunate brothers and sisters.\" \n\n\"Cryptoraptor\" (meaning \"secret thief\") is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a dinosaur.  The remains, NMMNH P-17375, consist of a fragmentary skeleton including vertebrae, a pubis, and parts of the thigh bones.  This specimen came from the Norian-age Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation in Quay County.  Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished dissertation, proposed the name \"Cryptoraptor lockleyi\" for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007).  In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauria. \n\n\"Comanchesaurus\" is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a theropod dinosaur.  The remains, NMMNH P-4569, consist of a partial skeleton including vertebral centra and hindlimb bones, and came from the Norian-age Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation of Guadalupe County.  Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished dissertation, proposed the name \"Comanchesaurus kuesi\" for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007).  In the redescription, the authors found the material to belong to a \"possible indeterminate saurischian\". \n\nSphaerotholus is a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of the western United States and Canada.  To date, three species have been described: the type species, \"S. goodwini\", from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation (Late Campanian) of San Juan County, New Mexico, USA; \"S. buchholtzae\", from the Hell Creek Formation (Late Maastrichtian) of western Carter County, Montana, USA; and \"S. edmontonense\", from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada.  The etymology of \"Sphaerotholus\" is a combination of the Greek \"sphaira\", meaning \"ball\", and \"tholos\", meaning \"dome\", and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull.  The survival of \"Sphaerotholus\" from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8\u00a0million years) and a widespread distribution.  Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: \"Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node.\"  \"Sphaerotholus\" is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur. \n\nMark Thomas Ciardi (born August 19, 1961; pronounced CHAR-dee) is an American film producer and former Major League Baseball pitcher.

        "context": "The United States presidential election of 2012 was the 57th quadrennial American presidential election.  It was held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012.  The Democratic nominee, incumbent President Barack Obama, and his running mate, Vice President Joe Biden, were elected to a second term, defeating the Republican nominee, former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney and his running mate, Representative and future House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. \n\nThe 2016 Michigan Democratic primary took place on March 8 in the U.S. state of Michigan as one of the Democratic Party's primaries ahead of the 2016 presidential election. \n\nThe United States presidential election of 1964 was the 45th quadrennial presidential election.  It was held on Tuesday, November 3, 1964.  Democratic candidate and incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson had come to office less than a year earlier following the assassination of his predecessor John F. Kennedy.  Johnson, who had successfully associated himself with Kennedy\u2019s popularity, won 61.1% of the popular vote, the highest win by a candidate since James Monroe\u2019s re-election in 1820.  It was the most lopsided US presidential election in terms of popular votes, and the tenth-most lopsided presidential election in the history of the United States in terms of electoral votes.  No candidate for president since has equalled or surpassed Johnson\u2019s percentage of the popular vote, and since 1820, only Abraham Lincoln in 1864, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, Richard Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 have won by a greater electoral vote margin. \n\nThe United States presidential election of 2020, scheduled for Tuesday, November 3, 2020, will be the 59th quadrennial U.S. presidential election.  Voters will select presidential electors who in turn will either elect a new president and vice president through the electoral college or re-elect the incumbents.  The series of presidential primary elections and caucuses are likely to be held during the first six months of 2020.  This nominating process is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's nominating convention, who then in turn elect their party's presidential nominee. \n\nThe United States presidential election of 1960 was the 44th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 1960.  The Republican Party nominated incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon, while the Democratic Party nominated John F. Kennedy, U.S. Senator from Massachusetts.  The incumbent President, Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, was not eligible for re-election after being elected the maximum two times allowed by the Twenty-second Amendment; he was the first President denied the choice to run for a third term by that amendment.  This was the first presidential election in which residents in Alaska and Hawaii were able to participate, as both had become states in 1959. \n\nThe United States presidential election of 1968 was the 46th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 5, 1968.  The Republican nominee, former Vice President Richard Nixon, won the election over the Democratic nominee, incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey.  Analysts have argued the election of 1968 was a major realigning election as it permanently disrupted the New Deal Coalition that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years. \n\nThe United States presidential election of 1892 was the 27th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 1892.  It witnessed a re-match of the closely contested presidential election in 1888.  Former Democratic President Grover Cleveland and incumbent Republican President Benjamin Harrison both ran for election to a second term.  In 1888, Cleveland won the popular vote over Harrison, but lost in the electoral college.  In a re-match, Cleveland won both the popular and electoral vote, thus becoming the first and to date only person in American history to be elected to a second, non-consecutive presidential term.  The new Populist Party, formed by groups from The Grange, the Farmers' Alliances, and the Knights of Labor, also fielded a ticket; they polled best in the West, winning in five states and taking a total of 22 electoral votes. \n\nThe United States presidential election of 1976 was the 48th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 2, 1976.  The winner was the Dark horse candidate Jimmy Carter, a former Governor from Georgia with his running mate, Walter Mondale, a U.S. Senator from Minnesota, the Democratic candidates, over the incumbent President Gerald Ford from Michigan and his running mate, Bob Dole, a U.S. Senator from Kansas, the Republican candidates. \n\nThe United States presidential election of 2016 was the 58th quadrennial American presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016.  In a surprise victory, the Republican ticket of businessman Donald Trump and Indiana Governor Mike Pence defeated the Democratic ticket of former First Lady, U.S. Senator of New York and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Senator from Virginia Tim Kaine.  Trump took office as the 45th President, and Pence as the 48th Vice President, on January 20, 2017.  Concurrent with the presidential election, Senate, House, and many gubernatorial and state and local elections were also held on November 8. \n\nThe United States presidential election of 2044, scheduled for Tuesday, November 8, 2044, will be the 65th quadrennial U.S. presidential election.  Voters will select presidential electors who in turn will either elect a new president and vice president through the electoral college or re-elect the incumbents.  The series of presidential primary elections and caucuses are likely to be held during the first six months of 2044.  This nominating process is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's nominating convention, who then in turn elect their party's presidential nominee. \n\n",

        "context": "The Sussex chicken is a dual purpose breed of chicken that originated in England around the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43 that is a popular garden chicken in many countries.  They come in eight colours (with a couple more being developed) and have a bantam version at 1/4 size; the bantams may be any of the eight colours. \n\nThe Durotriges were one of the Celtic tribes living in Britain prior to the Roman invasion.  The tribe lived in modern Dorset, south Wiltshire, south Somerset and Devon east of the River Axe and the discovery of an Iron Age hoard in 2009 at Shalfleet, Isle of Wight gives evidence that they lived in the western half of the island.  After the Roman conquest, their main \"civitates\", or settlement-centred administrative units, were Durnovaria (modern Dorchester, \"the probable original capital\") and Lindinis (modern Ilchester, \"whose former, unknown status was thereby enhanced\").  Their territory was bordered to the west by the Dumnonii; and to the east by the Belgae. \n\nAD 43 (XLIII) was a common year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar.  At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Vitellius (or, less frequently, year 796 \"Ab urbe condita\").  The denomination AD 43 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. \n\nThe Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, whose general Aulus Plautius served as first governor of Roman Britain (Latin: \"Britannia\" ).  Great Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire.  In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south. \n\nRomano-British culture is the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire following the Roman conquest in AD 43 and the creation of the province of Britannia.  It arose as a fusion of the imported Roman culture with that of the indigenous Britons, a people of Celtic language and custom.  It survived the 5th century Roman departure from Britain.  Scholars such as Christopher Snyder believe that during the 5th and 6th centuries \u2013 approximately from AD 410 when the Roman legions withdrew, to AD 597 when St Augustine of Canterbury arrived \u2013 southern Britain preserved an active sub-Roman culture that survived the attacks from the Anglo-Saxons and even used a vernacular Latin when writing. \n\nThe history of Wales begins with the arrival of human beings in the region thousands of years ago.  Neanderthals lived in what is now Wales, or \"Cymru\" in Welsh, at least 230,000 years ago, while \"Homo sapiens\" arrived by about 31,000 BC.  However, continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period after the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC, and Wales has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age.  During the Iron Age the region, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was dominated by the Celtic Britons and the Brittonic language.  The Romans, who began their conquest of Britain in AD 43, first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the Deceangli, and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the Ordovices in 79.  The Romans departed from Britain in the 5th century, opening the door for the Anglo-Saxon invasion.  Thereafter Brittonic language and culture began to splinter, and several distinct groups formed.  The Welsh people were the largest of these groups, and are generally discussed independently of the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples after the 11th century. \n\nEngland became inhabited more than 800,000 years ago, as the discovery of flint tools and footprints at Happisburgh in Norfolk has revealed.  The earliest evidence for early modern humans in North West Europe, a jawbone discovered in Devon at Kents Cavern in 1927, was re-dated in 2011 to between 41,000 and 44,000 years old.  Continuous human habitation in England dates to around 13,000 years ago (see Creswellian), at the end of the last glacial period.  The region has numerous remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age, such as Stonehenge and Avebury.  In the Iron Age, England, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was inhabited by the Celtic people known as the Britons, including some Belgic tribes (e.g. the Atrebates, the Catuvellauni, the Trinovantes, etc.) in the south east.  In AD 43 the Roman conquest of Britain began; the Romans maintained control of their province of Britannia until the early 5th century. \n\nThe list of Roman hoards in Britain comprises significant archaeological hoards of coins, jewellery, precious and scrap metal objects and other valuable items discovered in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) that are associated with period of Romano-British culture when Southern Britain was under the control of the Roman Empire, from AD 43 until about 410, as well as the subsequent Sub-Roman period up to the establishment of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.  It includes both hoards that were buried with the intention of retrieval at a later date (personal hoards, founder's hoards, merchant's hoards, and hoards of loot), and also hoards of votive offerings which were not intended to be recovered at a later date, but excludes grave goods and single items found in isolation. \n\nThe Corieltauvi (formerly thought to be called the Coritani, and sometimes referred to as the Corieltavi) were a tribe of people living in Britain prior to the Roman conquest, and thereafter a \"civitas\" of Roman Britain.  Their territory was in what is now the English East Midlands.  They were bordered by the Brigantes to the north, the Cornovii to the west, the Dobunni and Catuvellauni to the south, and the Iceni to the east.  Their capital was called \"Ratae Corieltauvorum\", known today as Leicester. \n\nThe Catuvellauni were a Celtic tribe or state of southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest, attested by inscriptions into the 4th century. \n\n",

        "context": "The Crooked Hinge is a mystery novel (1938) by detective novelist John Dickson Carr.  It combines a seemingly impossible throat-slashing with elements of witchcraft, an automaton modelled on Maelzel's Chess Player, and the story of the Tichborne Claimant.  It was dedicated to fellow author Dorothy Sayers \"in friendship and esteem.\" \n\nPenny Mickelbury (born 1948) is an African-American playwright and mystery novelist who worked as a print and television journalist for ten years before concentrating on fiction writing.  After leaving journalism, she taught fiction and script writing in Los Angeles and saw two of her plays (\u2018\u2019Waiting for Gabriel\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019Hush Now\u2019\u2019) produced there.  She began writing detective novels with \"Keeping Secrets\", published by Naiad Press in 1994, the first of a series featuring 'Gianna Maglione\u2019, a lesbian chief of a hate-crimes unit based in Washington D.C. and her lover 'Mimi Patterson', a journalist.  Her second series features \u2018Carol Ann Gibson\u2019, a Washington D.C attorney who is widowed in the first book and subsequently runs an investigation agency with 'Jake Graham', the detective who investigated her husband\u2019s death.  Her third features 'Phil Rodriguez', a Puerto Rican private investigator on the Lower Easter Side of New York City. \n\nThe Lake District Mysteries are a series of detective novels by British crime writer Martin Edwards.  The books feature Hannah Scarlett and the historian Daniel Kind, and are the first series of crime novels by a British detective novelist to be set in the Lake District, a region in North-West England. \n\nHe Who Whispers is a mystery novel (1946) by detective novelist John Dickson Carr.  Like Many of the works by this author feature so-called impossible crimes (for the most part, falling into the category of the locked room mystery).  In this case, the novel falls into a smaller category of Carr's work in that it is suggested that the crime is the work of a supernatural being (here, a vampire).  The detective is Dr. Gideon Fell, who ultimately uncovers a rational explanation for the novel's events.  Carr considered this one of his best impossible crime novels. \n\nJune Thomson (also known as June Valerie Thomson), (born 1930, in Rettendon, Essex, United Kingdom) is a detective novelist. \n\nAndy Straka is a Shamus Award-winning American crime novelist.  Born and raised in upstate New York and a graduate of Williams College, he worked in publishing and medical sales for nearly fifteen years before turning to writing in the late 1990s.  His debut private-eye novel, \"A Witness Above\", garnered Shamus, Anthony, and Agatha Award nominations for \"Best First Novel\" in 2002.  \"A Killing Sky\" received an Anthony Award nomination in 2003, and Straka's third book, \"Cold Quarry\", won a 2004 Shamus Award.  His series of six Frank Pavlicek novels features a former New York City police detective who also spends much of his time flying various hawks to help inspire him to solve criminal cases.  The fourth novel in the Pavlicek series, \"Kitty Hitter\", was called a \"great read\" by Library Journal.  \"Kitty Hitter\" was re-released with a new title, \"The Night Falconer\", as an e-book and paperback.  A fifth book featuring Pavlicek is the novella \"Flightfall\".  Another full-length novel, \"The K Street Hunting Society\", was released as book 6 in the Pavlicek series in 2014. \n\nRubislaw Quarry was opened in 1740 and is located at the Hill of Rubislaw in the west end of the Scottish city of Aberdeen.  In 1778/9, Aberdeen City Council sold it to a businessman for \u00a313, as it was not thought to be a source of good building material.  However, over the next 200 years, an estimated six million tonnes of granite were excavated from the quarry, giving Aberdeen the name of 'The Granite City'.  Rubislaw Quarry is one of the biggest man-made holes in Europe. \n\nRupaye Dus Karod is a 1991 Indian Bollywood suspense thriller film directed by Sikander Bharti and produced by Waman K. Dehsmukh and written by Shabdh Kumar.  The film was made in the style of formula-based potboilers and was a hit.  It stars Rajesh Khanna in the lead role and supporting cast includes Chunky Pandey, Amrita Singh, Sonu Walia, Avinash Wadhavan, Deepika Chikhalia, Sadashiv Amrapurkar, Kiran Kumar in pivotal roles.  Rupaye Dus Karod (ten crores of rupees) is the story of a detective novelist (writing in Hindi) - Ravi Varma (Rajesh Khanna) whose father had to flee from India in his childhood itself because of a conspiracy masterminded by his wicked business partners and later Ravi finds himself in mystery murder and another plot to have tried to earn 10 crore by fraudulent means . \n\nSue Taylor Grafton (born April 24, 1940) is a contemporary American author of detective novels.  She is best known as the author of the 'alphabet series' (\"\"A\" Is for Alibi\", etc.) featuring private investigator Kinsey Millhone in the fictional city of Santa Teresa, California.  The daughter of detective novelist C. W. Grafton, she has said the strongest influence on her crime novels is author Ross Macdonald.  Prior to success with this series, she wrote screenplays for television movies. \n\nC. Hugh Holman (February 24, 1914 - October 14, 1981) was an American literary scholar, academic administrator and detective novelist.

        "context": "Steven Bradford (born January 12, 1960) is an American politician currently serving in the California State Senate.  He is a Democrat representing the 35th district, encompassing parts of Los Angeles County.  Prior to his election to the state senate, he was an assemblymember for the 62nd district of the California State Assembly.  Bradford was elected to represent the 51st district in a special election held on September 1, 2009, after Curren Price resigned his seat to take a seat in the California State Senate.  He was re-elected in 2010 and, with 72% of the vote, was elected once more to represent the brand new 62nd District, comprising the communities of Del Aire, Del Rey, El Segundo, Gardena, Hawthorne, Inglewood, Lawndale, Lennox, Marina del Rey, West Athens, Westchester, Westmont and Venice Beach. \n\nJohn A. Alario, Jr. (born September 15, 1943), is the current President of the Louisiana State Senate.  He has served in the Louisiana State Legislature since 1972.  He was a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1972 to 2008.  Alario was Speaker of the House twice.  In 2007, he was elected to the Louisiana State Senate.  He is currently serving his third term as a senator and his second term as the President of the State Senate.  He is the second person in Louisiana and fourth in United States history to have been elected as both Speaker of his state House of Representatives and President of his state Senate. \n\nNew York's 2nd State Senate district is one of 62 districts of the New York State Senate.  It is currently represented by John J. Flanagan (R).  Senator Flanagan is New York State Senate's majority leader and temporary president. \n\n\"Nesting\" is the delimitation of voting districts for one elected body in order to define the voting districts for another body.  For example, in California, the State Assembly (the lower house) is composed of 80 members, each one representing 1/80th of California's population, and the State Senate (the upper house) is composed of 40 members, each one representing 1/40th of California's population.  In this case, the process of nesting could either be first defining the 80 Assembly districts, and then defining the Senate districts as a merge of two Assembly districts, or first defining the 40 Senate districts, and then creating the Assembly districts by splitting each Senate district into two.  If the Assembly districts and the Senate districts are created independently of each other, then the process of nesting is not used. \n\nThe California State Senate is the upper house of the California State Legislature.  Due to the state's large population and relatively small legislature, the State Senate has the largest population per representative ratio of any state legislative house.  In the United States House of Representatives, California is apportioned 53 representatives, each representing approximately 704,566 people, while in the State Senate, each of the 40 Senators represents approximately 931,349 people, with the result that California state senators each actually represent more voters than California's representatives to the United States Congress do.  Each member roughly represents a population equivalent to the state of Delaware.  As a result of Proposition 140 in 1990 and Proposition 28 in 2012, members elected to the legislature prior to 2012 are restricted by term limits to two four-year terms (eight years), while those elected in or after 2012 are allowed to serve 12 years in the legislature in any combination of four-year state senate or two-year state assembly terms. \n\nNew York's 4th State Senate district is one of 62 districts of the New York State Senate.  It is currently represented by Philip M. Boyle (R). \n\nNew York's 1st State Senate district is one of 62 districts of the New York State Senate.  It is currently represented by Senator Kenneth LaValle (R). \n\nThe Hawai\u02bbi State Senate is the upper chamber of the Hawaii State Legislature.  The senate consists of twenty-five members elected from an equal number of constituent districts across the islands.  The senate is led by the President of the Senate, elected from the membership of the body, currently Ron Kouchi.  The forerunner of the Hawaii State Senate during the government of the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bb i was the House of Nobles originated in 1840.  In 1894 the Constitution of the Republic of Hawaii renamed the upper house the present senate.  Senators are elected to four-year terms and are not subject to term limits.  Like most state legislatures in the United States, the Hawaii State Senate is a part-time body and senators often have active careers outside government.  The lower chamber of the legislature is the Hawai\u02bbi House of Representatives.  The membership of the Senate also elects additional officers to include the Senate Vice President, Senate Chief Clerk, Assistant Chief Clerk, Senate Sergeant at Arms and Assistant Sergeant at Arms. \n\nAndrea Stewart-Cousins (Democrat, Independence and Working Families) is a New York State Senator and the first woman in New York State history to lead a conference in Albany.  The Yonkers resident represents the 35th State Senate district in New York which in its present configuration includes Ardsley, Dobbs Ferry, Elmsford, Greenburgh, Hastings-on-Hudson, Irvington, Tarrytown, Scarsdale and parts of Yonkers, White Plains, and New Rochelle.  Prior to being elected to the New York State Senate, she was a Westchester County Legislator.  She was elected to the New York State Senate in 2006.  In 2012, her colleagues chose her to be the first female legislative leader; she currently serves as Democratic Conference Leader. \n\nNew York's 3rd State Senate district is one of 62 districts of the New York State Senate.  It is currently represented by Thomas Croci (R). \n\n",

It is a right tributary of the Ems and originates at the confluence of the Sagter Ems and the Soeste (Dreyschloot) near the town of Bar\u00dfel.  The Leda flows into the Ems near the town of Leer.  On the southern bank of the Leda, in the \"Overledingen Land\" (Overledingen=\"country over the Leda\"), opposite Leer, lies the small settlement of Kloster Muhde (\"Muhde\" from the Old Frisian \"mutha\" meaning \"(river) mouth\").  The total length of the river is 29 km , of which the lower 1.9 km are navigable for sea-going vessels. \n\nProto-Norse (also called Proto-Scandinavian, Primitive Norse, Proto-Nordic, Ancient Nordic, Ancient Scandinavian, Old Nordic, Old Scandinavian, Proto-North Germanic, North Proto-Germanic or Common Scandinavian) was an Indo-European language spoken in Scandinavia that is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of Proto-Germanic in the first centuries CE.  It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language attested in the oldest Scandinavian Elder Futhark inscriptions, spoken around from the 2nd to 8th centuries (corresponding to the late Roman Iron Age and the Germanic Iron Age).  It evolved into the dialects of Old Norse at the beginning of the Viking Age in about 800, which later themselves evolved into modern North Germanic languages. \n\nSuorva or Suorvadammen (the Suorva Dam) is a small settlement situated at the southern parts of Akkajaure, in Stora Sj\u00f6fallet National Park, Sweden.  The settlement can be reached by car (and bus, from G\u00e4llivare).  It consists of a few houses and a dam operated by Vattenfall, which regulates the flow to the hydroelectric plant in Vietas located about 5 kilometers downstream.  The road over the dam is normally open for hikers (not cars) and makes for a possible route into the northern parts of Sarek National Park which does not require using a boat. \n\nFrankish (reconstructed Frankish: \"*Frenkisk\"), Old Franconian or Old Frankish was the West Germanic language spoken by the Franks between the 4th and 8th century.  The language itself is poorly attested, but it gave rise to numerous loanwords in Old French.  Old Dutch is the term for the Old Franconian dialects spoken in the Low Countries, ie.  in present-day Belgium, in the present Netherlands and Western parts of today's Germany until about the 12th century when it evolved into Middle Dutch. \n\nOld Saxon, also known as Old Low German, was a Germanic language and the earliest recorded form of Low German (spoken nowadays in Northern Germany, the northeastern Netherlands, southern Denmark, the Americas and parts of Eastern Europe).  It is a West Germanic language, closely related to the Anglo-Frisian languages.  It has been documented from the 8th century until the 12th century, when it gradually evolved into Middle Low German.  It was spoken throughout modern northwestern Germany, primarily in the coastal regions and in the eastern Netherlands by Saxons, a Germanic tribe who inhabited the region of Saxony.  It partially shares Anglo-Frisian's (Old Frisian, Old English) Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law which sets it apart from Low Franconian and Irminonic languages, such as Dutch, Luxembourgish and German. \n\nAfrikaans ( ) is a West Germanic language spoken in South Africa, Namibia and, to a lesser extent, Botswana and Zimbabwe.  It evolved from the Dutch vernacular of South Holland (Hollandic dialect) spoken by the mainly Dutch settlers of what is now South Africa, where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century.  Hence, it is a daughter language of Dutch, and was previously referred to as \"Cape Dutch\" (a term also used to refer collectively to the early Cape settlers) or \"kitchen Dutch\" (a derogatory term used to refer to Afrikaans in its earlier days).  However, it is also variously described as a creole or as a partially creolised language.  The term is ultimately derived from Dutch \"Afrikaans-Hollands \" meaning \"African Dutch\".  It is the first language of most of the Afrikaners and Coloureds of Southern Africa. \n\nLeer is a town in the district of Leer, the northwestern part of Lower Saxony, Germany.  It is situated on the river Leda, a tributary of the river Ems, near the border with the Netherlands. \n\nDutch (\u00a0\u00a0 ) is a West Germanic language that is spoken by around 24 million people as a first language\u2014including the population of the Netherlands and about sixty percent that of Belgium\u2014and by another 5 million as a second language.  It is the third most widely spoken Germanic language, after English and German. \n\nEnglish is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now a global \"lingua franca\".  Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea.  It is closely related to the Frisian languages, but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as by Latin and Romance languages, particularly French. \n\nGerman (\"Deutsch\" ] ) is a West Germanic language that is mainly spoken in Central Europe.  It is the most widely spoken and (co-) official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein.  It is also one of the three official languages of Luxembourg.  The languages which are most similar to German are the other members of the West Germanic language branch: Afrikaans, Dutch, English, the Frisian languages, Low German/Low Saxon, Luxembourgish, and Yiddish.  German is the second most widely spoken Germanic language, after English. \n\n",

It covers the densely vegetated slopes of \"Lung Fu Shan\", including the disused Pinewood Battery as well as the Pinewood Garden picnic area, providing a scenic backdrop to the residential and commercial districts of Hong Kong Island.  In proximity to residential areas in the Mid-levels and the Western District, Lung Fu Shan area is intensively used by the public, especially by morning walkers and picnickers.  It is situated at the north of Pok Fu Lam Country Park.  Towards the east of Lung Fu Shan Country Park is Hatton Road, to the south is Harlech Road whereas to the north and west is a covered conduit constructed by the Water Supplies Department.  This country park covers an area of about 47 hectares, making it the smallest country park in Hong Kong (not including special areas).  It is also the newest country park, according to the establishment date. \n\nHatton Castle stands on the lower part of Hatton Hill, the most easterly of the Sidlaw Hills, to the south of Newtyle in Angus, Scotland.  The castle overlooks the wooded Den of Newtyle, and its views extend across Strathmore and include Ben Lawers and Schiehallion as well as the Angus and Glenshee hills.  The 16th-century castle was originally built in a typical Scottish \"Z plan\" tower house design, as a fortified country house or \"ch\u00e2teau\".  There was an earlier castle called Balcraig Castle which stood less than half a mile from the present building, also on Hatton Hill. \n\nHatton Castle is almost 3 miles south-east of Turriff, Aberdeenshire in the north-east of Scotland.  Formerly known as Balquholly Castle, sometimes spelt as \"Balquollie\", it was renamed in 1814.  The 17994 sqft mansion was designated a category A listed building in 1972; the gardens are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. \n\nAngus cattle are naturally polled and solid black or red even though the udder may be white.  The native colour is black, but more recently red colours have emerged.  The UK registers both in the same herd book, but in the US they are regarded as two separate breeds\u00a0\u2013 Red Angus and Black Angus.  Black Angus is the most common breed of beef cattle in the US, with 324,266 animals registered in 2005.  In 2014, the British Cattle Movement Service named Angus the UK's most popular native beef breed, and the second most popular beef breed overall. \n\nHatton Hill is a mountain landform in Angus, Scotland and is the most easterly peak of the Sidlaw Hills.  Hatton Castle stands on the flanks of Hatton Hill above the village of Newtyle. \n\nHutton Castle is located in the Scottish Borders, overlooking the Whiteadder Water.  It stands 2.5 km southeast of Chirnside and 11 km west of Berwick-on-Tweed.  It has also been known as Hatton Hall and Hutton Hall. \n\nHatton (grid reference [ SP242670] ) is a village and civil parish about 4 mi north of Warwick, in the Warwick District of Warwickshire in England.  It had a population of 1,078 at the 2001 Census, increasing to 2,319 at the 2011 Census.  Notable features include a remarkable series of 21 locks on the Grand Union Canal, a shopping village (Hatton Country World) and a former psychiatric hospital (Central Hospital, Hatton) that has been turned into a large housing estate while still preserving the original Victorian buildings.  The public house, Hatton Arms, was historically noted for its regular large assemblies of motorcycles.  Other public houses in the area include the Falcon Inn, although less well known as it is situated further away from the village centre. \n\nAuchterhouse Castle is a c. 13th century castle located northwest of Dundee, Angus, Scotland.  The original castle was enclosed with walls, towers, and contained a keep.  The castle may have been in ownership of the Ramsay family, who were hereditary Sheriffs of Angus.  Sir William Wallace is alleged to have stayed at the castle and one its towers was named in his honour.  King Edward I of England spent the night of the 20 July 1303 at the castle.  The castle came into the possession of James Erskine, 7th Earl of Buchan who may have built the 17th century tower house. \n\nThe Hatton Baronetcy, of Long Stanton in the County of Cambridge, was a title in the Baronetage of England.  It was created on 5 July 1641 for Thomas Hatton, Member of Parliament for Corfe Castle, Malmesbury and Stamford.  The title became extinct on the death of the tenth Baronet in 1812. \n\nBroughty Castle is a historic castle on the banks of the river Tay in Broughty Ferry, Dundee, Scotland.  It was completed around 1495, although the site was earlier fortified in 1454 when George Douglas, 4th Earl of Angus received permission to build on the site.  His son Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus was coerced into ceding the castle to the crown.  The main tower house forming the centre of the castle with four floors was built by Andrew, 2nd Lord Gray who was granted the castle in 1490. \n\n",

Undrafted by the National Football League, Ken caught on with the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League.  Following two seasons there, he played a season with the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League.  However, Rose dreamed of playing in the NFL and attended several training camps in the mid-1980s, only to be rejected each time.  He received an opportunity with the New York Jets in 1987 during the strike by the players union, and became one of the few \"scabs\" to stay on the roster when the regular players returned to work.  Rose remained with the Jets through 1989.  In 1990, he split playing time with the Cleveland Browns and the Philadelphia Eagles, released by the Browns (along with head coach Bud Carson) after the seventh game and signing with the Eagles for their final 8 regular-season games.

        "context": "Colin Murray \"Gem\" Archer (born 7 December 1966) is an English musician, best known as a member of the English rock bands Oasis, Beady Eye and Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.  He is also known for his work with Heavy Stereo.  He joined Oasis as rhythm guitarist in November 1999, and handled lead guitar for acoustic songs as well.  He also contributed to the writing of some of the band's songs.  Oasis broke up in August 2009, but in November 2009, Liam Gallagher announced he was writing new material with Archer as well as other ex-Oasis members minus his brother Noel, under the name Beady Eye.  After two albums with Beady Eye, 2011's \"Different Gear, Still Speeding\" and 2013's \"BE\", the band officially disbanded in October 2014.  In 2017, Archer joined Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds as lead guitarist, thus reuniting with former Oasis member Noel Gallagher. \n\n\"Imagine\" is a song written and performed by English musician John Lennon.  The best-selling single of his solo career, its lyrics encourage the listener to imagine a world at peace without the barriers of borders or the divisions of religion and nationality, and to consider the possibility that the whole of humanity would live unattached to material possessions. \n\n5:55 is the second album by French musician and actress Charlotte Gainsbourg.  It is also her first album release in twenty years.  Charlotte collaborated on the album with French duo Air, English musician Jarvis Cocker, and Irish singer-songwriter Neil Hannon, as well as Radiohead's main producer Nigel Godrich.  \"The Songs That We Sing\" and \"5:55\" were released as singles.  The album went platinum in France, selling over 500,000 copies.  In the United States, the album sold a modest 22,000 copies.  \"The Songs That We Sing\" was #78 on \"Rolling Stone\"' s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. \n\nSharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter.  Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy.  Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included.  Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures.  This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it.  If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views.  When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others.  You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances.  According to Gannon: \"How you treat others will determine how others treat you.  How others treat you will determine how you see yourself.  How you see yourself will determine who you are.\" \n\n\"We Laughed\" is a three-track single by English musician Billy Bragg as part of the Rosetta Life project.  The single was released in 2005 in the UK and peaked at No. 11.  It also reached No. 38 in Ireland in 2006.  For the three songs on the single, Bragg collaborated with three patients of Trimar Hospice in Weymouth, who each wrote lyrics based on their illness and feelings.  The songs were produced by English guitarist Robbie McIntosh. \n\nLove Songs: A Compilation... Old and New is a compilation album by English musician Phil Collins.  The album was released by Atlantic Recording Corporation and Rhino Entertainment on 28 September 2004.  The album was released only a few months after the box set \"The Platinum Collection\", which appeared earlier in the year (see 2004 in music). \n\nNo Plan is an extended play, comprising songs written and recorded by English musician David Bowie, released posthumously on 8 January 2017.  The release coincided with what would have been Bowie's 70th birthday, almost a year after his death.  \"No Plan\" compiles the original songs written for Bowie's Broadway musical, \"Lazarus\", including the titular \"Lazarus\", \"No Plan\", \"Killing a Little Time\", and \"When I Met You\".  The songs were first recorded by the cast of the musical as part of its official soundtrack.  The recordings featured on \"No Plan\" come from the sessions for Bowie's twenty-fifth and final studio album \"Blackstar\", with \"Lazarus\" appearing as the third track on the album.  Upon release, \"No Plan\" debuted at #138 on the \"Billboard\" 200.  The music video for the title track was also released in accompaniment with the EP.  It was directed by Tom Hingston. \n\nEnglish musician Syd Barrett recorded many songs during his short career as a musician.  One of the founding members of English rock band Pink Floyd, he was the dominant force of the band in their early years, writing most of the material found on their first album, \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\", contributing to their second one, \"A Saucerful of Secrets\", and recording several unreleased songs with the band.  Due to increasing mental illness, Barrett was excluded from Pink Floyd in April 1968 and was subsequently replaced by guitarist David Gilmour.  After Pink Floyd, Barrett would record two solo albums, both released in 1970, before Barrett left the music business entirely in 1972. \n\n\"Who Can See It\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1973 album \"Living in the Material World\".  The lyrics reflect Harrison's uneasy feelings towards the Beatles' legacy, three years after the group's break-up, and serve as his statement of independence from expectations raised by the band's unprecedented popularity.  Some music critics and biographers suggest that he wrote the song during a period of personal anguish, following the acclaim he had received as a solo artist with the 1970 triple album \"All Things Must Pass\" and his 1971\u201372 Bangladesh aid project.  The revelatory nature of the lyrics has encouraged comparisons between \"Living in the Material World\" and John Lennon's primal therapy-inspired 1970 release, \"Plastic Ono Band\". \n\n\"See Yourself\" is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1976 album \"Thirty Three & 1/3\".  Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD.  McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity.  In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions.  Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks \"Within You Without You\" and \"All You Need Is Love\". \n\n",

        "context": "Frederick \"Doc\" Doherty (June 15, 1887 \u2013 February 12, 1961) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player.  Doherty played hockey for several professional ice hockey teams from 1908 until 1916, including a stint with the Toronto Ontarios in the National Hockey Association (NHA).  He also played in the Maritime Professional Hockey League and the Ontario Professional Hockey League.  After returning from World War I duty, he played one game in the National Hockey League with the Montreal Canadiens to end his career.  He played on several league champions, leading to play in several Stanley Cup championships, but was not a member of a Stanley Cup-winning team. \n\nTravis John Richards (born March 22, 1970) is a former professional ice hockey defenseman.  Richards graduated from Robbinsdale Armstrong High School in Plymouth, Minnesota in 1988.  Richards was a member of the University of Minnesota Gophers hockey program before making his professional debut during the 1993-94 season.  A child psychology major, Richards would spend four years at the University of Minnesota where his brother Todd was a Gopher from 1985 to 1989.  Earning WCHA Second Team All-Star honors on defense in 1992 and in 1993, Richards would join the US National Team at the 1993 World Championships at the end of his senior year.  Drafted by the Minnesota North Stars of the National Hockey League in the ninth round (169th overall) of the 1988 NHL Entry Draft, Richards played only three games in the NHL for the Dallas Stars .  On July 26, 1996, Richards became the second player ever to sign with the Grand Rapids Griffins, then of the International Hockey League, now of the American Hockey League.  Richards played in each of the team's first ten seasons and became team captain in 2001.  He holds the record for most career games as a Griffin with 655.  Richards's number 24 was retired by the Griffins upon his retirement, becoming the first number retired by the club .  For a time he was the hockey director at The Edge Ice Arena in Holland, Michigan.  He resides in Grand Rapids, MI and has 2 daughters and one son, Ellie, Melissa and Riley. \n\nThe 20th National Hockey League National Hockey League All-Star Game was played in Montreal Forum on January 18, 1967, where the host Montreal Canadiens defeated a team of all-stars from the remaining NHL teams 3\u20130.  It was the first, and to date, only time a shutout occurred in an All-Star Game.  It was the first All-Star Game held in mid-season.  The previous Game was held in October 1965. \n\nThe National Hockey League All-Star Game (French: \"Match des \u00c9toiles de la Ligue Nationale de Hockey\" ) is an exhibition ice hockey game that is traditionally held during the regular season of the National Hockey League (NHL), with many of the League's star players playing against each other.  The Game's proceeds benefit the pension fund of the players. \n\nThe 57th National Hockey League All-Star Game was held at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, home of the Montreal Canadiens, in conjunction with the Montreal Canadiens centennial celebrations on Sunday evening, January 25, 2009.  The game was held between two teams, each representing a conference (Eastern and Western) of the National Hockey League (NHL).  The Eastern Conference team won the game 12\u201311, decided by shootout.  The next NHL All-Star Game, the 58th, was held in 2011 in Raleigh, North Carolina, instead of 2010, due to the 2010 Winter Olympics, which were held in Vancouver, an NHL city. \n\nThe 60th National Hockey League All-Star Game was an exhibition ice hockey game played on January 25, 2015.  The game was held in Columbus, Ohio, for the first time, at Nationwide Arena, home of the Columbus Blue Jackets.  The team captains were chosen by NHL Hockey Operations: Nick Foligno of the All-Star Game-hosting Blue Jackets served as captain for the home team, and Jonathan Toews of the Chicago Blackhawks served for the away team.  Team Toews won the game 17\u201312, as the teams and players broke a variety of All-Star Game scoring records. \n\nThe NHL All-Star Game SuperSkills Competition, originally known as the National Hockey League All-Star Skills Competition, is an event on the night preceding the All-Star Game.  Started at the 41st National Hockey League All-Star Game in Pittsburgh in 1990, the NHL uses the event to showcase the talents of its all-star participants.  Events include accuracy shooting, fastest skater, Skills Challenge Relay, hardest shot, Breakaway Challenge, and an Elimination Shootout.  The All-Star teams select representatives for each event, with points awarded to the winning team. \n\nThe Stanley Cup is a trophy awarded annually to the playoff champion club of the National Hockey League (NHL) ice hockey league.  It was donated by the Governor General of Canada Lord Stanley of Preston in 1892, and is the oldest professional sports trophy in North America.  Inscribed the \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\", the trophy was first awarded to Canada's amateur ice hockey clubs who won the trophy as the result of challenge games and league play.  Professional clubs came to dominate the competition in the early years of the twentieth century, and in 1913 the two major professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) (forerunner of the NHL) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other in an annual series for the Stanley Cup.  After a series of league mergers and folds, it became the \"de facto\" championship trophy of the NHL in 1926, though it was nominally still subject to external challenge.  After 1947, the Cup became the \"de jure\" NHL championship prize. \n\nThe 44th National Hockey League All-Star Game was the last NHL All-Star Game to take place at the Montreal Forum on February 6, 1993.  Before the start of the Game, there was a tribute to Mario Lemieux, who was in attendance but could not play due to his treatments for Hodgkin's Disease.  Mike Gartner would take Mark Messier's place in the All-Star lineup and ended up becoming the fourth player in All-Star history to score four goals in one game, earning All-Star MVP honours.  The final score was Wales Conference 16, Campbell Conference 6.  This was also the first All-Star Game in which the San Jose Sharks sent a representative. \n\nRyan Johansen (born July 31, 1992) is a Canadian professional ice hockey centre, an alternate captain for the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL).  Growing up, he played minor hockey in the Greater Vancouver area until joining the junior ranks with the Penticton Vees of the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL) for one season.  In 2009\u201310, he moved to the major junior level with the Portland Winterhawks of the Western Hockey League (WHL).  After his first WHL season, he was selected fourth overall by the Blue Jackets in the 2010 NHL Entry Draft.  Internationally, he has competed for the Canadian national junior team at the 2011 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he earned a silver medal and was named to the Tournament All-Star Team.

        "context": "Rebel Highway was a short-lived revival of American International Pictures created and produced by Lou Arkoff, the son of Samuel Z. Arkoff and Debra Hill for the Showtime channel in 1994.  The concept was 10-week series of 1950s \"drive-in classic\" B-movies remade \"with a '90s edge\".  The impetus for the series, according to Arkoff was, \"what it would be like if you made \"Rebel Without a Cause\" today.  It would be more lurid, sexier, and much more dangerous, and you definitely would have had Natalie Wood's top off\".  Originally, Arkoff wanted to call the series, \"Raging Hormones\" but Showtime decided on \"Rebel Highway\" instead.  Arkoff and Hill invited several directors to pick a title from one of Samuel Arkoff's movies, hire their own writers and create a story that could resemble the original if they wanted.  In addition, they had the right to a final cut and select their own director of photography and the editor.  Each director was given a $1.3 million budget and 12 days to shoot it with a cast of young, up and coming actors and actresses.  According to Arkoff, the appeal to directors was that, \"They weren't hampered by big studios saying, 'You can't do this or that.'  And all the directors paid very close attention to the detail of the era.  We want these shows to be fun for the younger generation and fun for the older generation\". \n\nSalvatore Mineo, Jr. (January 10, 1939February 12, 1976), was an American film and theatre actor, known for his performance as John \"Plato\" Crawford opposite James Dean in the film \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955).  He was twice nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for his roles in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" and \"Exodus\" (1960). \n\n\"Rebel Without a Pause\" is a song by hip hop group Public Enemy and the first single from their 1988 album, \"It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back\".  The title is a reference to the 1955 film \"Rebel Without a Cause\". This is also the first song to sample Funky Drummer. \n\nJames Gilmore Backus (February 25, 1913 \u2013 July 3, 1989) was an American radio, television, film, and voice actor.  Among his most famous roles were the voice of nearsighted cartoon character Mr. Magoo, the rich Hubert Updike III on the radio version of \"The Alan Young Show\", Joan Davis' character's husband (a domestic court judge) on TV's \"I Married Joan\", James Dean's character's father in \"Rebel Without a Cause\", and Thurston Howell III, on the 1960s sitcom \"Gilligan's Island\".  He also starred in his own show of one season, \"The Jim Backus Show\", also known as \"Hot Off the Wire\". \n\nCorey Allen (June 29, 1934 \u2013 June 27, 2010) was an American film and television director, writer, producer, and actor.  He began his career as an actor but eventually became a television director.  He may be best known for playing the character Buzz Gunderson in Nicholas Ray's \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955). \n\nMy Teenage Daughter, later Teenage Bad Girl, is a 1956 British drama film directed by Herbert Wilcox and starring Anna Neagle, Sylvia Syms and Norman Wooland.  The screenplay concerns a mother who tries to deal with her teenage daughter's descent into delinquency.  It was intended as a British response to \"Rebel Without a Cause\".  It was the last commercially successful film made by Wilcox. \n\nCasey Braxton is a fictional character from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera \"Home and Away\", played by Lincoln Younes.  Casey made his first on-screen appearance on 17 February 2011.  Younes was about to go travelling when he auditioned for the role of Casey.  He changed his plans upon winning the role.  In late 2010 the Seven Network began airing trailers for a new trio of characters known as \"The River Boys\".  The trio consist of Casey and his older half-brothers Darryl (Steve Peacocke) and Heath Braxton (Dan Ewing).  The River Boys arrive in Summer Bay from neighbouring town Mangrove River.  Casey is characterised as being a \"modern day \"Rebel Without a Cause\"\"; who is intelligent and unsure about what he wants out of life.  Younes has described him as the \"epitome of teenage angst\".  The River Boys cause trouble in Summer Bay and producers were inspired by Koby Abberton's Bra Boys in the creation process.  Casey is portrayed as wanting to distance himself from their bad reputation; but his anger issues often mar his attempts. \n\nStewart Henry Stern (March 22, 1922 \u2013 February 2, 2015) was an American screenwriter.  He is best known for writing the screenplay for the film \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955), starring James Dean. \n\nJack Grinnage (born January 20, 1931) is an American actor with a film and television career spanning seven decades.  Born in Los Angeles, Grinnage made his first television appearances in 1954.  The following year, he played as Moose \u2013 one of three teenage rebels who chase James Dean \u2013 in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955).  \"Rebel Without a Cause\" was his first movie where he received a screen credit. \n\nThe Cheers were an American rock and roll vocal group, that had a string of hits in the mid-1950s starting with \"(Bazoom) I Need Your Lovin'.\"  which hit number three on the U.S. chart in 1954.  This was the first hit written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller to chart on the Pop charts in the United States, and was one of the first rock and roll hits by a white group (after The Crew Cuts and Bill Haley and the Comets).  The following year, they followed it up with \"Black Denim Trousers and Motorcycle Boots\" (also written by Leiber and Stoller), a song about a wild-living leather-jacketed motorcyclist, which went to number six on the charts.  The Cheers members included Bert Convy (1933\u20141991) who would later serve as host of several daytime television game shows such as \"Tattletales\", \"Super Password\", \"Win, Lose or Draw\" and \"3rd Degree\", Sue Allen and Gil Garfield (1933\u20142011).  Leiber and Stoller wrote and produced 'Chicken' (1955) for The Cheers, parodying the central sequence from James Dean's film \"Rebel Without a Cause\". \n\n",

A total of 96 episodes of \"Dexter\" were broadcast over eight seasons.  The series is based on characters created by Jeff Lindsay for his \"Dexter\" series of novels.  The series follows the life of Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a Miami Metro Police Department blood pattern analyst with a double life.  While investigating murders in the homicide division, Dexter hunts and kills murderers and criminals who have escaped the justice system.  Although the first season is based on the events of \"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\", the series' subsequent seasons do not follow the novels in the series.  Departing from the narrative of Lindsay's second Dexter novel \"Dearly Devoted Dexter\", the show's writer Daniel Cerone said that the writers \"didn't see the opportunity in the second book\" to adapt it. \n\n\"The British Invasion\" is the twelfth episode and finale of the second season, and twenty-fourth overall episode, of the American television drama series \"Dexter\", which first aired on 16 December 2007 on Showtime in the United States.  The episode was written by Daniel Cerone (based on a story by Cerone and Melissa Rosenberg) and was directed by Steve Shill.  In the episode, Lila Tournay (Jaime Murray) finds Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) imprisoned in an Everglades cabin and learns from him that her object of affection, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), is the serial killer known as the \"Bay Harbor Butcher\".  She decides to help Dexter and kills Doakes by setting the cabin on fire.  Meanwhile, Dexter's sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) questions whether her career is more important than her relationship with FBI Special Agent Frank Lundy (Keith Carradine). \n\nDexter is an American television crime drama mystery series that aired on Showtime from October 1, 2006, to September 22, 2013.  Set in Miami, the series centers on Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a forensic technician specializing in blood spatter pattern analysis for the fictional Miami Metro Police Department, who leads a secret parallel life as a vigilante serial killer, hunting down murderers who have slipped through the cracks of the justice system.  The show's first season was derived from the novel \"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\" (2004), the first of the Dexter series novels by Jeff Lindsay.  It was adapted for television by screenwriter James Manos, Jr., who wrote the first episode.  Subsequent seasons evolved independently of Lindsay's works. \n\nMichael Carlyle Hall (born February 1, 1971) is an American actor, known for his roles as Dexter Morgan, a serial killer and blood spatter analyst, in the Showtime TV Network series \"Dexter\", and as David Fisher in the HBO drama series \"Six Feet Under\".  In 2010, Hall won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his role in \"Dexter\". \n\n\"The Damage a Man Can Do\" is the eighth episode of the third season of the American television drama series \"Dexter\", which first aired on November 16, 2008 on Showtime in the United States.  The episode was written by Scott Buck and directed by Marcos Siega.  In the episode, assistant district attorney Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits) asks Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) for his assistance in killing a murderous gambler.  Meanwhile, Dexter's sister Ofr.  Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) finds her boyfriend and informant Anton Briggs (David Ramsey) to be missing after she tells him that he is no longer legally obligated to work for her. \n\nVincent \"Vince\" Masuka (Masuoka in the books) is a fictional character in the Showtime television series \"Dexter\" and the novels by Jeff Lindsay upon which the series is based.  On television he is portrayed by Korean-American C. S. Lee.  Masuka is the Miami Metro Police lead forensic science investigator; he works alongside Dexter Morgan in the lab and at crime scenes.  He often cracks tasteless and inappropriate jokes, when convenient invokes his Japanese heritage and harbors unrequited desire for Dexter's foster sister Debra.  Although goofy and obsessed with sex, he is clever and very good at his job, causing Dexter to worry from time to time that Masuka will uncover his secret. \n\nSage Kirkpatrick is an actress probably best known for playing Dexter Morgan's mother, Laura Moser, in the Showtime TV drama series, \"Dexter\". \n\nDarkly Dreaming Dexter is a 2004 novel by Jeff Lindsay, the first in his series about serial killer Dexter Morgan.  It formed the basis of the Showtime television series \"Dexter\" and won the 2005 Dilys Award and the 2007 Book to TV award. \n\n\"It's Alive!\"  is the second season premiere and thirteenth overall episode of the American television drama series \"Dexter\", which first aired on September 30, 2007 on Showtime in the United States.  The episode was written by Daniel Cerone and was directed by Tony Goldwyn.  In the episode, which takes place five weeks after the first-season finale, Sgt. James Doakes (Erik King) is following Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) at all times, but when he gets his first opportunity Dexter finds himself unable to kill.  Meanwhile, his sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) returns to work after her ex-fianc\u00e9 Brian tried to kill her, and his girlfriend Rita Bennett (Julie Benz) refuses to believe that Dexter sent her ex-husband Paul (Mark Pellegrino) to prison in spite of the evidence in front of her. \n\n\"Hello, Dexter Morgan\" is the 11th and penultimate episode of the fourth season of Showtime TV series, Dexter, which aired on December 6, 2009.

Use of the term \"party switch\" can also connote a transfer of held power in an elected governmental body from one party to another. \n\nThe Party of Communists in Hungary (Hungarian: \"Kommunist\u00e1k Magyarorsz\u00e1gi P\u00e1rtja\" ), renamed Hungarian Communist Party (\"Magyar Kommunista P\u00e1rt\" ) in October 1944, was founded on November 24, 1918, and was in power in Hungary briefly from March to August 1919 under B\u00e9la Kun and the Hungarian Soviet Republic.  The communist government was overthrown by the Romanian Army and driven underground.  The party regained power following World War II and held power from 1945 under the leadership of M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi.  In 1948 the party merged with the Social Democrats to become the Hungarian Working People's Party.  The Communist Party of Hungary was a member of the Communist International. \n\nFederal elections for the House of Representatives were held in Australia on 2 December 1972, and were won by the Australian Labor Party led by Gough Whitlam.  Labor won 67 of the 125 seats contested and defeated the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister William McMahon and Coalition partner the Country Party led by Doug Anthony.  The elections ended 23 years of successive Coalition governments which held power since 1949. \n\nGeneral elections were held in Sweden on 19 September 1982.  They saw the return of the Swedish Social Democratic Party to power after six years in opposition, the longest period in opposition by the Social Democrats since the 1910s.  The center-right coalition of Thorbj\u00f6rn F\u00e4lldin had earlier suffered a loss upon the breakup of the government in 1981, the year before the election, when the rightist Moderate Party chose to withdraw from the government, protesting against the centrist tax policies of the F\u00e4lldin government.  After regaining power, socialist leader Olof Palme succeeded in being elected Prime Minister again, having earlier held power between 1969 and 1976.  He would retain this position successfully until his assassination in 1986. \n\nTefik Selim Mborja (1888-1954) was an Albanian politician and lawyer.  He served as the general secretary of the Albanian Fascist Party during the Second World War. \n\nThe United Bermuda Party (UBP) was a political party in Bermuda.  It represented itself as centrist party in favour of a moderate social and fiscal agenda.  Having held power in Bermuda's House of Assembly continuously from 1968 to 1998, the 47-year-old party officially ceased operations on 30 June 2011 after the majority of its members joined the One Bermuda Alliance. \n\nThe fourth legislative assembly election of Madras State (later renamed as Tamil Nadu) was held in February 1967.  The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) led coalition under the leadership of C.N. Annadurai won the election defeating the Indian National Congress (Congress).  Anti-Hindi agitations, the rising prices of essential commodities and a shortage of rice were the dominant issues.  K. Kamaraj's resignation as the Chief Minister in 1963, to concentrate on party affairs, along with persistent rumours of corruption had weakened the incumbent Congress Government.  This was the second time after Communist Party of India winning Kerala assembly elections in 1957, for a non-Congress party to gain majority in a state in India, and the last time that Congress held power in Tamil Nadu.  It was the first time a party or pre-election alliance was formed a nob-Congress government with absolute majority.  It marked the beginning of Dravidian dominance in the politics of Tamil Nadu.  Annadurai, who became the first non-Congress chief minister of post-independence Tamil Nadu, died in office in 1969 and V.R. Nedunchezhiyan took over as acting chief minister. \n\nThe Confederation of Mexican Workers (Spanish: \"Confederaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores de M\u00e9xico (CTM)\" ) is the largest confederation of labor unions in Mexico.  For many years, it was one of the essential pillars of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI), which ruled Mexico for more than seventy years.  However, the CTM began to lose influence within the PRI structure in the late 1980s, as technocrats increasingly held power within the party.  Eventually, the union found itself forced to deal with a new party in power after the PRI lost the 2000 general election, an event that drastically reduced the CTM's influence in Mexican politics. \n\nBal'arab bin Himyar (died 1749) was one of the rival Imams during the civil wars in Oman in the final years of the Yaruba dynasty.  He was elected Imam in 1728, holding power in the interior of Oman while his cousin, Saif bin Sultan II, held power on the coast.  In 1737 he renounced his claim after being defeated by Saif's Persian allies.  He was again elected Imam in 1743 during another Persian invasion, and again held power in the interior while Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi was recognized as ruler by the coastal people.  He died in battle against Ahmad bin Said in 1749.  Ahmad became the undisputed ruler of the country. \n\nAlbania ( , ; Albanian: \"Shqip\u00ebri/Shqip\u00ebria\" ; Gheg Albanian: \"Shqipni/Shqipnia, Shqypni/Shqypnia\" ), officially the People's Socialist Republic of Albania (), was a socialist state that ruled Albania from 1946 to its fall in 1992.  From 1946 to 1976 it was known as the People's Republic of Albania, and from 1944 to 1946 as the Democratic Government of Albania.  Throughout this period the country had a reputation for its Stalinist style of state administration dominated by Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania and for policies stressing national unity and self-reliance.  Travel and visa restrictions made Albania one of the most difficult countries to visit or to travel from.  In 1967, it declared itself the world's first atheist state.  It was the only Warsaw Pact member to formally withdraw from the alliance before 1990, an action occasioned by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968.  The first multi-party elections in Socialist Albania took place on 31 March 1991 \u2013 the communists gained a majority in an interim government and the first parliamentary elections were held on 22 March 1992.  The People's Socialist Republic was officially dissolved on 28 November 1998 upon the adoption of the new Constitution of Albania. \n\n",

        "context": "The LSU\u2013Ole Miss football rivalry, renamed the Magnolia Bowl in 2008, is an American college football rivalry game played annually by the LSU Tigers football team of Louisiana State University (LSU) and the Ole Miss Rebels football team of the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss).  The teams compete for the Magnolia Bowl Trophy.  The Tigers and the Rebels first met in 1894, and have been regular opponents in Southeastern Conference (SEC), meeting annually since 1945.  The rivalry was at its height during the 1950s and 1960s, when both teams were highly ranked and during which time both teams claimed a national championship.  The rivalry died down from the 1970s to the 1990s, owing to Ole Miss not returning to conference or national prominence since the 1970s and because LSU has seen new rivalries emerge when the SEC split into two divisions in 1992, most notably Alabama, Arkansas, Auburn, and Florida.  Even though the rivalry has not attracted the same national attention in recent years, it still stirs up passion in both Oxford and Baton Rouge. \n\nThe Oregon Ducks football program is a college football team for the University of Oregon, located in the U.S. state of Oregon.  The team competes at the NCAA Division I level in the FBS and is a member of the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12).  Known as the Ducks, the team was commonly called the Webfoots until the mid-1960s.  The first football team was fielded in 1894.  Oregon plays its home games at the 54,000 seat Autzen Stadium in Eugene; its main rivals are the Oregon State Beavers and the Washington Huskies.  The Ducks and Beavers historically end each regular season with the Civil War rivalry game in late November. \n\nWayne Harrison Walker (September 30, 1936\u00a0\u2013 May 19, 2017) was an American professional football player and sports broadcaster.  He played fifteen seasons with the Detroit Lions of the National Football League, as a linebacker and placekicker.  Walker played in 200 regular season games, the second most for a defensive player at the time.  He played in three Pro Bowls and was thrice selected as a first-team All-NFL player.  After the 1972 season, he retired as a player and was a sports broadcaster for CBS and the sports director for KPIX-TV in San Francisco from 1974 to 1994.  Walker was a weekend sportscaster during the off-season during his later years as a Detroit Lion. \n\nThe 1983 Oregon State vs. Oregon football game was a college football game played on November 19, 1983, at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon, the 87th playing of the annual Civil War rivalry game.  The game ended in a scoreless tie.  Since overtime was added to NCAA Division I games in 1996, this game is likely to be the last ever with that distinction. \n\nThe Battle of the Blue is an annual college football rivalry game between the University of Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens and Villanova University Wildcats.  The first game was played between the two teams in 1895, was played annually from 1964 to 1980 when Villanova dropped football, and then resumed with the re-emergence of Villanova football having been played annually since 1988.  Beginning in 2007, the annual Delaware\u2013Villanova game became known as Battle of the Blue.  As part of this concept, the winning team gets to keep the Battle of the Blue Trophy at its institution for the year and is responsible for bringing the trophy to the following installment of the rivalry game.  The trophy consists of a football with a Villanova logo and the Wildcat shade of blue on one side and the Blue Hen logo and the Delaware shade of blue on the other side.  The ball sits in a wooden platform and the scores of each game are engraved on the base of the trophy.  Villanova had possession of the trophy for the first four years, until Delaware won in 2011. \n\nThe Civil War is the colloquial name for an American college football rivalry game played annually in Oregon, between the Ducks of the University of Oregon in Eugene and the Beavers of Oregon State University in Corvallis.  First played in 1894, it is the fifth most played college football rivalry game in NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision.  Both universities are members of the North Division of the Pac-12 Conference. \n\nThe Rivalry is an American college football rivalry game played by the Lafayette Leopards football team of Lafayette College and the Lehigh Mountain Hawks football team of Lehigh University.  It is the most-played football rivalry in the nation and the longest uninterrupted annual rivalry series.  As of 2016, \"The Rivalry\" has been played 152 times since 1884 with only a single interruption in 1896.  The college's football teams met twice annually (except 1891, when they played three games, and 1896, when they did not play at all) until 1901.  The two institutions are located seventeen miles apart in the Lehigh Valley in eastern Pennsylvania.  Though primarily alluding to football, \"The Rivalry\" pertains to a meeting between the two schools in all sports and other endeavors. \n\nThe Army\u2013Navy Game is an American college rivalry game in college football between the Army Black Knights of the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, and the Navy Midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy (USNA) at Annapolis, Maryland.  The Black Knights (formerly the \"Army Cadets\" and \"Army Black Knights\") and Midshipmen each represent their service's oldest officer commissioning sources.  As such, the game has come to embody the spirit of the interservice rivalry of the United States Armed Forces.  The game marks the end of the college football regular season and the third and final game of the season's Commander-in-Chief's Trophy series, which also includes the Air Force Falcons of the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) near Colorado Springs, Colorado. \n\nThe Battle for the Bell is an American college football rivalry game played by the Marshall Thundering Herd football team of Marshall University and the Ohio Bobcats football team of Ohio University.  It is a regional rivalry, with the universities' campuses located about 80 miles (130\u00a0km) from each other, with a bell awarded as the trophy for the winner of the game.  With Marshall's move from the Mid-American Conference to Conference USA in 2005, this rivalry game was on hiatus for several years.  The series unexpectedly resumed in 2009 when the Herd and Bobcats faced off in the 2009 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl, which Marshall won 21\u201317.  A six-year contract between the schools began in 2010.  Ohio leads the all-time series over Marshall 33\u201320\u20136. \n\nThe Textile Bowl is an American college football rivalry game played annually by the Clemson Tigers football team of Clemson University and the NC State Wolfpack football team of North Carolina State University.  The rivalry game has been known as the Textile Bowl since 1981.  The two universities are founding members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), and both have competed in the ACC's Atlantic Division since the conference initiated divisional play.  The rivalry's name is derived from the fact that Clemson and North Carolina State have two of the largest university-level textile schools in the world, and from the textile industry's historic importance in the economic development of their respective states of South Carolina and North Carolina. \n\n",

He has written novels, stories, plays, journalism and poetry, and has been widely translated, including in English Point/Erasing, translated by Anne Marie Glasheen (Daedalus, 2003) and In Reality, translated by Zo\u00eb Skoulding (Seren Press, 2013).  He is a translator of poetry into French from Spanish, Italian, English and German.

Portante\u2019s collection of poems L\u2019Etrange langue (Editions Le Taillis Pr\u00e9, 2002) won the Mallarm\u00e9 award in France in 2003, and the same year he was given the Grand Prix d\u2019Automne de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Gens de Lettres for his entire life\u2019s work in poetry.  In 2005, Le Castor Astral published a selected poems, La Cendre des mots, covering his work from 1989 to 2005.  Since 2006 he has been a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Mallarm\u00e9.  In 2008 he co-founded the French poetry magazine \"Inuits dans la jungle\" with the poet Jacques Darras, while in Luxembourg he heads the literary magazine Transkrit.  In 2011 he was awarded Luxembourg\u2019s Batty Weber National Prize, which is given every three years for a life\u2019s work.

He was born in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.  His cartoon \"Bousquet\" regularly appears in \"The Providence Journal\", \"Rhode Island Monthly\", and the \"South County Independent\" and his work has also appeared in numerous other publications, such as \"Yankee Magazine\".

Hart studied architecture at Bath and Cambridge Universities (Trinity Hall), where he was taught by Michael Brawne, Patrick Hodgkinson, Peter Smithson and Dalibor Vesely.  He worked first as an architectural assistant to Colin St John Wilson on the British Library project in London, before studying for a doctorate in Cambridge on Inigo Jones under Joseph Rykwert.  Hart's concerns lie in particular with the symbolic function of architecture, and with the meaning of architectural forms.  Hart has published widely in the field of architectural history, specialising in the Italian architectural treatises and in British architectural history of the Renaissance and Baroque periods.  He is the co-translator (with Peter Hicks) of the treatises of Sebastiano Serlio, and he has also translated the two guidebooks to Rome published by Andrea Palladio and the guidebook to Venice by Francesco Sansovino (2017).  These works have in turn been translated into Chinese and Japanese.  Hart's translation of these classic works formed part of a wider project initiated by Rykwert and Robert Tavernor through their translation of the treatise by Leon Battista Alberti.  In addition, Hart's monographs include influential studies of the work of Inigo Jones, Sir John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor, all published by Yale University Press for the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art.  The latter monograph was awarded the Best Book on British Art Prize of the American College Art Association in 2005. \n\nProfessor Ghulam Nabi Firaq (15 July 1927 - 17 December 2016) was a Kashmiri poet, writer and an educationist.  From the last fifty years he had been writing poetry and prose.  In doing so he used, besides traditional ones, several poetic forms including blank verse, free verse, sonnets, quatrains, metric poems and lyrics.  He also translated dozens of English poems of outstanding English poets into Kashmiri.  As a result of all this, he enriched the expression of the language and made it more suitable for communicating his sensibility which in nature is modern.  Besides, he had been writing essays and articles in Kashmiri language, which was his mother tongue, and which he had made the vehicle of expression from early fifties.  As a literary critic and historian he had been trying to evaluate the Kashmiri poetry of the last five hundred years and rehabilitate it by bringing to prominence among other things its intrinsic merit and power of expression.  He also holds the Sahitya Akademi Award for his works in Kashmiri literature.  He is regarded as one of the very few people of Kashmir who has been trying to preserve the rich Kashmiri culture, heritage and language. \n\nJohn Bradley Hirst, (9 July 1942 \u2013 3 February 2016) was an Australian historian and commentator.  He has been described as an \"historian, public intellectual, and active citizen\".

Abandoning an early desire to become a Methodist Minister, in 1968 he was appointed a lecturer at Melbourne's new La Trobe University, where he remained until the end of his career.  His wife and fellow-student Christine accompanied him to Melbourne.  They had two children, Catherine and David.  Hirst was subsequently head of department and Reader in History at La Trobe.  He retired in 2006, and was an Emeritus Scholar at La Trobe until his death.  Hirst had a distinguished career \"in teaching, supervision and research.  He developed new subjects and methodologies to teach them.  In addition to those concerning Australian history there was his pioneering subject designed to inform students about Australia's European cultural heritage.\"  This work was published as \"The Shortest History of Europe\" and has been translated into nine languages (Swedish, Greek, Chinese, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Russian, Turkish and Korean).  Hirst was seconded to the University of Melbourne to edit \"Historical Studies\", Australia's leading historical journal, from 1977 to 1980.  In retirement, he travelled regularly to Sydney to instruct, without remuneration, groups of post-graduate students in thesis writing. \n\nThe Blackstone River and Canal Heritage State Park is a part of the state park system of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR).

        "context": "Chronic Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma.  These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma.  Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood.  These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV).  Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age.  HRV on the other hand is an important cause of bronchiolitis and is strongly associated with asthma development.  In children and adults with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma.  Thus, \"Chlamydia pneumoniae\", \"Mycoplasma pneumoniae\" and human rhinoviruses are microbes that play a major role in non-atopic asthma. \n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).  Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of SARS in southern China caused an eventual 8,098 cases, resulting in 774 deaths reported in 37 countries, with the majority of cases in Hong Kong (9.6% fatality rate) according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  No cases of SARS have been reported worldwide since 2004. \n\nYi Guan is a Chinese virologist who, in 2014, was ranked as 11th in the world by Thomson Reuters (now known as Clarivate Analytics) among global researchers in the field of microbiology.  His research on the viral respiratory disease SARS allowed the Chinese government to successfully avert the 2004 outbreak of this disease.  He is the current Director (China affairs) of the State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases University of Hong Kong.  In early 2017, Guan warned that the H7N9 influenza virus \"poses the greatest threat to humanity than any other in the past 100 years.\" \n\nThe Irish Thoracic Society (ITS) is the official society for professionals involved in the care of people with chronic or acute respiratory disease in Ireland.  Membership of the Society is drawn from respiratory physicians, internal medicine physicians, pediatricians, thoracic surgeons, general practitioners, junior doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, dietitians, pulmonary function and respiratory therapists, scientists and other healthcare providers who specialize or have an interest in respiratory disease and care throughout Ireland - North and South. \n\nChronic Respiratory Disease is a quarterly peer-reviewed medical journal that covers research in the field of respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory failure, and obstructive sleep apnea.  The editors-in-chief are Mike Morgan (Glenfield Hospital), Carolyn Rochester (Yale University), and Sally Singh (Glenfield Hospital).  It was established in 2004 and is published by SAGE Publications. \n\nFeline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) is an upper respiratory or pulmonary infection of cats caused by \"feline herpesvirus 1\", of the family \"Herpesviridae\".  It is also commonly referred to as feline influenza, feline coryza, and feline pneumonia but, as these terms describe other very distinct collections of respiratory symptoms, they are misnomers for the condition.  Viral respiratory diseases in cats can be serious, especially in catteries and kennels. Causing one-half of the respiratory diseases in cats, FVR is the most important of these diseases and is found worldwide.  The other important cause of feline respiratory disease is \"feline calicivirus\". \n\nAspirin-induced asthma, also termed Samter's triad, Samter's syndrome, aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), and recently by an appointed task force of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology/World Allergy Organization (EAACI/WAO) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-exacerbated respiratory disease (N-ERD).  is a medical condition initially defined as consisting of three key features: asthma, respiratory symptoms exacerbated by aspirin, and nasal/ethmoidal polyposis; however, the syndrome's symptoms are exacerbated by a large variety of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugss (NSAIDs) besides aspirin.  The symptoms of respiratory reactions in this syndrome are hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs rather than the typically described true allergic reactions that trigger other common allergen-induced asthma, rhinitis, or hives.  The NSAID-induced reactions do not appear to involve the common mediators of true allergic reactions, immunoglobulin E or T cells.  Rather, AERD is a type of NSAID-induced hypersensitivity syndrome.  EAACI/WHO classifies the syndrome as one of 5 types of NSAID hypersensitivity or NSAID hypersensitivity reactions. \n\nThe Journal of Thoracic Disease is a peer-reviewed open access medical journal covering pulmonology.  It was established in December 2009 and is published monthly by AME Publishing Company.  It is the official journal of the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, and the Society for Thoracic Disease.  The editor-in-chief is Zhong Nanshan (Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases).  According to the \"Journal Citation Reports\", the journal has a 2016 impact factor of 2.365. \n\nPulmonary rehabilitation, also known as respiratory rehabilitation, is an important part of the management and health maintenance of people with chronic respiratory disease who remain symptomatic or continue to have decreased function despite standard medical treatment.  It is a broad therapeutic concept.  It is defined by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society as an evidence-based, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive intervention for patients with chronic respiratory diseases who are symptomatic and often have decreased daily life activities.  In general, pulmonary rehabilitation refers to a series of services that are administered to patients of respiratory disease and their families, typically to attempt to improve the quality of life for the patient.  Pulmonary rehabilitation may be carried out in a variety of settings, depending on the patient's needs, and may or may not include pharmacologic intervention. \n\nSARS is severe acute respiratory syndrome, a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the SARS coronavirus. \n\n",

In California, \"an insurer, who wrongfully refuses to accept a reasonable settlement within the policy limits is liable for the entire judgment against the insured even if it exceeds the policy limits.\"  A rationale for this duty is that \"[w]hen an offer is made to settle a claim in excess of policy limits for an amount within policy limits, a genuine and immediate conflict of interest arises between carrier and assured.\"  \"An insurer who denies coverage does so at its own risk.  Such factors as a belief that the policy does not provide coverage, should not affect a decision as to whether the settlement offer in question is a reasonable one.\"  \"It is the duty of the insurer to keep the insured informed of settlement offers.\" \" [A]n insurer potentially can be liable for unreasonably coercing an insured to contribute to a settlement fund.\" \n\nFraley, et al. v.

It lies southwest of the Falc\u00f3n Reservoir in Tamaulipas.  It was founded in what was known as \"Rancho Huizachal de los Canales\".  The name \"Par\u00e1s\" is derived from Jose Mar\u00eda Par\u00e1s y Ballesteros, the first constitutional governor of Nuevo Le\u00f3n.  Prior to the settlement the land was Gualeno Indian Tribe Territory and left many artifact the biggest being Piedras Pintas just a few miles northwest of the town.  The town is small in size but it has many smaller settlements and ranches under municipality jurisdiction.  The people of Par\u00e1s live of ranching and agriculture.  The population is not large at all due to the amount of people who fleeted throughout the years to the U.S. seeking employment.

Its geographical situation endowed it with a position of importance at the crossroads on the land based trade routes to Arabia, the Egyptian empire to the south and the Canaan region to the north.  The site (dated between 3500-2350 BCE) appears to be the predecessor to the Tell al-'Ajjul settlement, where geomorphological dynamics of the estuary caused settlement trans-location or abandonment.  The site dates from a period prior to the Egyptian military domination of the Levant.  The pottery finds at Tell es-Sakan along with Tell al-'Ajjul shows a strong ancient Egyptian link to the area, while the Bronze Age settlement at Taur Ikhbeineh has revealed a more localised pottery production with Egyptian-Canaanite interaction. \n\nMana Al Otaiba (Arabic: \u0645\u0627\u0646\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062a\u064a\u0628\u0647\u200e \u200e ) was born on 15 May 1946 to Saeed Al Otaiba in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.

        "context": "The 1999 Odisha cyclone (IMD designation BOB 03, JTWC designation 05B) was the strongest recorded tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean and among the most destructive in the region.  The 1999\u00a0Odisha cyclone organized into a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on 25\u00a0October, though its origins could be traced back to an area of storms in the Sulu Sea four days prior.  The disturbance gradually strengthened as it took a west-northwesterly path, reaching cyclonic storm strength the next day.  Taking advantage of highly favorable conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining super cyclonic storm intensity on 28\u00a0October before peaking with winds of 260\u00a0km/h (160\u00a0mph) and a record-low pressure of 912\u00a0mbar (hPa; 26.93\u00a0inHg).  The storm maintained this intensity as it made landfall on Odisha on 29\u00a0October.  The cyclone steadily weakened due to persistent land interaction and dry air, remaining quasi-stationary for two days before slowly drifting offshore as a much weaker system; the storm dissipated on 1\u00a0November over the Bay of Bengal. \n\nSuper Cyclonic Storm Gonu (also simply known as Cyclone Gonu) is the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Arabian Sea, and is also the strongest named cyclone in the northern Indian Ocean.  The second named tropical cyclone of the 2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Gonu developed from a persistent area of convection in the eastern Arabian Sea on June 1, 2007.  With a favorable upper-level environment and warm sea surface temperatures, it rapidly intensified to attain peak winds of 235\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) on June 4, according to the India Meteorological Department.  Gonu weakened after encountering dry air and cooler waters, and early on June 6, it made landfall on the easternmost tip of Oman, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the Arabian Peninsula.  It then turned northward into the Gulf of Oman, and dissipated on June 7 after making landfall in southern Iran, the first landfall in the country since 1898. \n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Donna was the strongest off-season South Pacific tropical cyclone on record during the month of May.  The twenty-first tropical disturbance, third named storm, and second severe tropical cyclone of the annual cyclone season, Donna formed from an area of disturbed weather that was first monitored west-northwest of Fiji on 1\u00a0May\u00a02017.  The disturbance drifted eastward amid an increasingly favorable environment, and it was designated Tropical Depression 21F late on 2\u00a0May.  Twelve hours later, it intensified into a Category\u00a01 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale and was designated Tropical Cyclone Donna as the storm's motion shifted west and then south.  After reaching its initial peak as a Category\u00a04 cyclone early on 6\u00a0May, the effects of wind shear and upwelling caused the storm to weaken.  However, it reintensified into a Category\u00a05 cyclone on 8\u00a0May.  Soon after, Donna entered a region of strong westerly flow and began to rapidly weaken.  Continuing to accelerate in a southerly direction, Donna eventually weakened into a tropical low on 10\u00a0May.  By 16\u00a0May, Donna's remnants had fully dissipated. \n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Anne was one of the most intense tropical cyclones within the South Pacific basin during the 1980s.  The cyclone was first noted on January 5, 1988 as a weak tropical depression to the northeast of Tuvalu, in conjunction with the future Typhoon Roy in the North-Western Pacific basin.  Over the next few days, the system gradually developed while moving southwestward.  Once it became a tropical cyclone, it was named Anne on January 8.  The next day, Anne rapidly intensified, becoming the fourth major tropical cyclone to affect Vanuatu within four years.  On January\u00a011, Anne peaked in intensity while it was equivalent to a Category\u00a05 on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale, and a Category\u00a04 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.  After turning southward on January 12, Anne struck New Caledonia, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the French Overseas Territory.  The system subsequently weakened as it started to interact with Tropical Cyclone Agi.  Anne weakened into a depression and was last noted on January 14 to the south-east of New Caledonia. \n\nSevere Tropical Cyclone Esau became the strongest tropical cyclone to affect New Caledonia on record during February and March 1992.  A shallow tropical depression developed within the monsoon trough during 24 February, about 370\u00a0\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi) to the northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu.  Over the next day the system gradually developed further as it moved towards the south-west under the influence of a northerly steering flow, before it passed over Pentecost Island in northern Vanuatu during 25 February.  After passing over Pentecost the system continued to move towards the southwest and passed near the island of Malampa, before the depression turned northwards and executed a small clockwise loop as it passed over the island of Espiritu Santo.  The system was subsequently named Esau during 26 February, after it had developed into a tropical cyclone.  Over the next couple of days the system moved south-westwards towards Australia and away from the islands of Vanuatu.  Esau subsequently executed a second clockwise loop during 28 February, before it peaked as a Category 4 tropical cyclone on both the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.  After it had peaked the system moved south-eastwards and threatened Southern Vanuatu, before turning southwards and threatening the French overseas territory of New Caledonia.  Esau made landfall on the French territory during 4 March, as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone before degenerating into an extratropical cyclone during 5 March.  The systems remnants made landfall on New Zealand's North Island during 8 March, before they were last noted during the next day over the South Pacific Ocean. \n\nTropical Cyclone Kesiny was the first recorded tropical cyclone \u2013 the equivalent of a minimal hurricane \u2013 to make landfall in the month of May 2002 in the south-west Indian Ocean.  The final named storm of the busy 2001\u201302 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Kesiny formed on May\u00a02 from a trough near the equator.  Its formation was the result of an increase in the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation, which also contributed to a twin storm in the north Indian Ocean that hit Oman, and another set of storms in northeast and southeast Indian Ocean.  Kesiny initially moved to the southeast, but later turned to the southwest due to a strengthening ridge.  On May\u00a06, it intensified into a tropical cyclone, but later weakened and was not expected to re-strengthen.  However, Kesiny developed an eye and re-intensified into a tropical cyclone on May\u00a09, reaching peak winds of 130 km/h before striking Madagascar about 60 km southeast of Antsiranana.  It weakened while crossing the country, and after turning to the south it struck the country again before dissipating on May\u00a011. \n\nIntense Tropical Cyclone Hondo (JTWC designation: 16S) was the strongest and longest lived tropical cyclone to develop during the 2007\u201308 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season.  The third tropical cyclone and first intense tropical cyclone of the season, Hondo developed out of a tropical disturbance in early February about 1,020\u00a0km (635\u00a0mi) east-southeast of Diego Garcia.  The disturbance quickly strengthened, becoming a moderate tropical storm on February\u00a04 and a severe tropical storm the following day.  After a brief period of slower intensification, Hondo rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone and reached its peak intensity with winds of 215\u00a0km/h (130\u00a0mph ) on February\u00a07.  The cyclone gradually weakened over the next several days due to an increase in forward speed and a decrease in sea surface temperatures.  On February\u00a012, Hondo rapidly degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area.  Over the following week, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwest direction with no development.  On February\u00a020, about 2,780\u00a0km (1,725\u00a0mi) northeast of where the final advisories were issued, the storm began to regenerate.  The next day, advisories were issued on Tropical Disturbance Ex-Hondo, which briefly strengthened into a tropical depression.  However, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Hondo continued to strengthen and attained winds of 95\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph ) before passing directly over R\u00e9union.  Interaction with the island caused the storm to weaken and degenerate into a remnant low once more.  The storm dissipated on February\u00a029 after executing a counterclockwise loop. \n\nThe 2002\u201303 Australian region cyclone season included Cyclone Inigo, which tied Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 as the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian basin.  It began on 1 November 2002 and ended on 30 April 2003.  The regional tropical cyclone operational plan also defines a \"tropical cyclone year\" separately from a \"tropical cyclone season\", which runs from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003.  These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Australian region, which is defined as in the southern hemisphere between 90\u00b0E and 180\u00b0E.  The season's ten tropical depressions existed within these dates, with the first, designated as Tropical Cyclone 07S, entering the basin on 27 December 2002.  The last system, Cyclone Epi, dissipated on 6 June 2003.  Tropical cyclones in this area were monitored by four Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs): the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) in Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane and one in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. \n\nThe 2010\u201311 South Pacific cyclone season was a slightly below average tropical cyclone season, with seven tropical cyclones and five severe tropical cyclones developing during the season.  The season ran from November 1, 2010 until April 30, 2011, though if any tropical cyclones had developed between July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011, the official \"tropical cyclone year\", they would have been counted towards the season's total.  Within the South Pacific basin tropical cyclones were officially monitored by the Fiji Meteorological Service's Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji, north of 25\u00b0S, and to the south the Meteorological Service of New Zealand's Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand.  Any disturbances forming in the region were designated with a sequential number suffixed by the letter F.  In addition, the United States Military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center unofficially monitored parts of the basin during the season, where any systems judged to have achieved tropical storm strength or greater received a number suffixed with the letter P. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measure wind speeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over a period of one minute which can be applied to the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale.  Seven named storms formed or moved into the South Pacific basin during the 2010\u201311 season, the strongest of which was Severe Tropical Cyclone Wilma in late January. \n\nThe 2011\u201312 South Pacific cyclone season was one of the least active South Pacific tropical cyclone seasons on record, with only three tropical cyclones occurring during the season.  The season ran from November 1, 2011 to April 30, 2012, however, any tropical cyclones that form before June 30, 2012 would have fallen within the 2011\u201312 tropical cyclone year and would have counted towards the season total.  The strongest and only severe tropical cyclone that occurred during the season was Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasmine, which tracked in from out of the South Pacific basin.  Within the basin, tropical cyclones are monitored by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand.  RSMC Nadi attaches an F designation to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the South Pacific.  The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues unofficial warnings within the South Pacific, designating tropical storm-equivalent or greater tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix.  RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measure windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over a period of one minute and uses the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. \n\n",

Released in North America on September\u00a015, 1999, \"American Beauty\" was positively received by critics and audiences alike; it was the best-reviewed American film of the year and grossed over $350 million worldwide.  Reviewers praised all aspects of the production, with particular emphasis on Mendes, Spacey and Ball; criticism tended to focus on the familiarity of the characters and setting.  At the 1999 Academy Awards, the film won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (for Spacey), Best Original Screenplay and Best Cinematography (for Conrad Hall).  The film was nominated for and won numerous other awards and honors, mainly for the direction, writing, and acting. \n\nMarjorie Stewart Joyner (October 24, 1896 \u2013 December 27, 1994) was an American businesswoman.  She was born in 1896, in Monterey, Virginia.  In 1912, she moved to Chicago and began studying cosmetology.  She graduated A.B. Molar Beauty School in Chicago in 1916, the first African American to achieve this.  There she met Madam C. J. Walker, an African American beauty entrepreneur, and the owner of a cosmetic empire.  Always a lover of women's cosmetics, Joyner went to work for her and oversaw 200 of Madame Walker's beauty schools as the national adviser.  A major role was sending Walker's hair stylists door-to-door, dressed in black skirts and white blouses with black satchels containing a range of beauty products that were applied in the customer's house.  Joyner taught some 15,000 stylists over her fifty-year career.  She was also a leader in developing new products, such as her permanent wave machine.  She helped write the first cosmetology laws for the state of Illinois, and founded a sorority and fraternity, Alpha Chi Pi Omega on October 27, 1945 as well as a national association for black beauticians.  Joyner was friends with Eleanor Roosevelt, and helped found the National Council of Negro Women.  She was an advisor to the Democratic National Committee in the 1940s, and advised several New Deal agencies trying to reach out to black women.  Joyner was highly visible in the Chicago black community, as head of the \"Chicago Defender\" Charity network, and fundraiser for various schools.

It is powered by a twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter inline 6-cylinder engine from Volvo S80 giving 300 bhp and a top speed of 205 mph .  The engine is located behind the driver.  Its design is obviously inspired by hot rod cars.  It was named the 2004 \"Hot Rod of the Year\" by Hot Rod Magazine.  It was designed by Per Gyllenspetz from Labyrint studio and built by Leif Tufvesson.

        "context": "Paris was the third ship of the \"Courbet\"-class battleship s, the first dreadnoughts built for the French Navy.  She was completed before World War I as part of the 1911 naval building programme.  She spent the war in the Mediterranean, spending most of 1914 providing gunfire support for the Montenegrin Army until her sister ship \"Jean Bart\" was torpedoed by the submarine \"U-12\" on 21 December.  She spent the rest of the war providing cover for the Otranto Barrage that blockaded the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Sea. \n\nUSS \"New Jersey\" (BB-62) (\"Big J\" or \"Black Dragon\") is an \"Iowa\"-class battleship , and was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named after the US state of New Jersey.  \"New Jersey\" earned more battle stars for combat actions than the other three completed \"Iowa\"-class battleships, and was the only US battleship providing gunfire support during the Vietnam War. \n\nTonkin Gulf Yacht Club was a tongue-in-cheek nickname for the United States Seventh Fleet during the Vietnam War.  All through the war in Vietnam, the Seventh Fleet engaged in combat operations against enemy forces through attack carrier air strikes, naval gunfire support, amphibious operations, patrol and reconnaissance operations and mine warfare. \n\nOperation Market Time was the United States Navy and South Vietnam\u2019s successful effort begun in 1965 to stop the flow of troops, war material, and supplies by sea, coast, and rivers, from North Vietnam into parts of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.  Also participating in Operation Market Time were United States Coast Guard Squadron One and Squadron Three.  The Coast Guard provided heavily armed 82 ft patrol boats and large cutters that included 5\" cannons used in battle and gunfire support. \n\nJean Bart was the second ship of the \"Courbet\"-class battleship s, the first dreadnoughts built for the French Navy.  She was completed before World War I as part of the 1910 naval building programme.  She spent the war in the Mediterranean and helped to sink the Austro-Hungarian protected cruiser \"Zenta\" on 16 August 1914.  She spent most of the rest of 1914 providing gunfire support for the Montenegrin Army until she was torpedoed by the submarine \"U-12\" on 21 December.  Even with three compartments flooded, she was able to steam to Malta on her own for repairs that required three and a half months.  Upon her return she spent the remainder of the war participating in the Otranto Barrage, in the Adriatic. \n\nNaval gunfire support (NGFS) (also known as shore bombardment) is the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range.  NGFS is one of a number of disciplines encompassed by the term \"Naval Fires\".  Modern naval gunfire support is one of the three main components of amphibious warfare assault operations support, along with aircraft and ship-launched land-attack missiles. Shipborne guns have been used against shore defences since the early days of naval warfare. \n\nStarting in the 1890s, the Italian \"Regia Marina\" (Royal Navy) began building a series of modern battleships.  Early designs were marked by their small size, light armor, and high speed compared to contemporary foreign counterparts.  The first pre-dreadnought battleship design, the \"Ammiraglio di Saint Bon\"\u00a0class , was constrained by budgetary limits imposed by the legislature.  Two ships were ordered by the class's namesake, Admiral Simone de Pacoret Saint Bon, though the design was also influenced by Benedetto Brin, who replaced di Saint Bon as naval minister after his death.  Brin designed the next pair of battleships, the \"Regina Margherita\"\u00a0class .  These ships were larger than the preceding class, and were intended to challenge the Austro-Hungarian \"Habsburg\"-class\u00a0battleship s then under construction.  Brin himself died during the construction process.  Vittorio Cuniberti designed the next class of small pre-dreadnoughts, the \"Regina Elena\"\u00a0class , which were the fastest battleships in the world at the time of their completion.  These ships all served in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911\u201312, where they were primarily used to provide naval gunfire support for the Italian ground troops, as the Ottoman Navy largely confined itself to port. \n\nKirov (Russian: \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432 ; ] ) was a Project 26 \"Kirov\"-class cruiser of the Soviet Navy that served during the Winter War, World War II and into the Cold War.  She attempted to bombard Finnish coast defense guns during action in the Winter War, but was driven off by a number of near misses that damaged her.  She led the Evacuation of Tallinn at the end of August 1941, before being blockaded in Leningrad where she could only provide gunfire support during the Siege of Leningrad.  She bombarded Finnish positions during the Vyborg\u2013Petrozavodsk Offensive in mid-1944, but played no further part in the war.  \"Kirov\" was reclassified as a training cruiser on 2 August 1961 and sold for scrap on 22 February 1974. \n\nThe United States naval gunfire support debate is an ongoing debate among the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Congress, and independent groups like the \"United States Naval Gunfire Support Association\" over what role naval gunfire support and naval surface fire support (NSFS) should play within the navy and how such a role can best be provided.  At the heart of the issue is the role that naval gunfire support\u2014the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range\u2014should play in the U.S. Navy of the 21st century. \n\nUSS \"Trippe\" (FF-1075) was a \"Knox\"-class frigate of the US Navy, built at Westwego, Louisiana, was commissioned in mid-September 1970.  In July 1971, following shakedown training in the Caribbean area and a surveillance mission off Haiti, she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for overhaul and installation of the Basic Point Defense Missile System, which featured short-range \"Sea Sparrow\" guided missiles in an eight-round launcher on her afterdeck.  \"Trippe\" was the Navy's first destroyer-type ship to receive this later-widespread contribution to shipboard protection against air and missile attack.  The first months of 1972 were spent testing her new weapons and participating in exercises.  In June the ship passed through the Panama Canal en route to Southeast Asian waters, where she provided Vietnam War aircraft carrier escort and naval gunfire support services during July and August.  \"Trippe\" then went to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf areas, visiting many ports in a region that would see increasing U.S. Navy activity in the coming decades.  She returned to the U.S. East Coast in December 1972, after a deployment that had taken her completely around the World. \n\n",

The park is located in the Hudson Plains ecozone, 45 km south of Churchill in north-east Manitoba, Canada, on the shores of Hudson Bay.

        "context": "Francis Hatch Kimball (1845\u20131919) was an American architect practicing in New York City, best known for his work on skyscrapers in lower Manhattan and terra-cotta ornamentation.  He was an associate with the firm Kimball & Thompson.  His work includes the Empire Building, Manhattan Life Insurance Building, and Casino Theatre (Broadway).  All but one of Kimball's work was in the United States. \n\nThe New York Life Insurance Building, New York, located at 51 Madison Avenue, Manhattan, New York City, across from Madison Square Park, is the headquarters of the New York Life Insurance Company. \n\nThe Manhattan Life Insurance Building was a 348 ft tower at 64-66 Broadway in New York City completed in 1894 to the designs of the architects of Kimball & Thompson and slightly extended north in 1904 making its new address 64-70 Broadway.  It was the first skyscraper to pass 100 m in Manhattan. \n\nPhysicians Mutual is a privately held insurance company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, United States, that consists of Physicians Mutual Insurance Company and Physicians Life Insurance Company.  Founded as Physicians Mutual Insurance Company in 1902 by Edwin E. Elliott, Physicians Mutual began by selling health insurance to medical professionals.  Policies were offered to the general public starting in 1962, and by 1970 the company expanded into life insurance when it founded Physicians Life Insurance Company.  Today the company offers a variety of insurance products, annuities, Medicare, Medigap, Medicare Supplement, Term Life Insurance, Whole Life Insurance, Cancer and funeral pre-planning services.  It holds over US$3 billion in assets and employs over one thousand people.  Robert A. Reed is chief executive officer and president. \n\nThe Flatiron Building, originally the Fuller Building, is a triangular 22-story steel-framed landmarked building located at 175 Fifth Avenue in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, and is considered to be a groundbreaking skyscraper.  Upon completion in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city at 20 floors high and one of only two skyscrapers north of 14th Street \u2013 the other being the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, one block east.  The building sits on a triangular block formed by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, and East 22nd Street, with 23rd Street grazing the triangle's northern (uptown) peak.  As with numerous other wedge-shaped buildings, the name \"Flatiron\" derives from its resemblance to a cast-iron clothes iron. \n\nManhattan Life Insurance Company, incorporated on May 29, 1850, is a life insurance company domiciled in New York but operates as a subsidiary of Manhattan Life Group in Houston, Texas. \n\nWhole life insurance, or whole of life assurance (in the Commonwealth of Nations), sometimes called \"straight life\" or \"ordinary life,\" is a life insurance policy which is guaranteed to remain in force for the insured's entire lifetime, provided required premiums are paid, or to the maturity date.  As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies.  Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term.  Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age.  The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid-up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65.  Whole life insurance belongs to the cash value category of life insurance, which also includes universal life, variable life, and endowment policies. \n\nThe Supreme Life Building is a historic insurance building located at 3501 S. Dr. Martin Luther King Drive in the Douglas community area of Chicago, Illinois.  Built in 1921, the building served as the headquarters of the Supreme Life Insurance Company, which was founded two years earlier.  The company, originally known as the Liberty Life Insurance Company, was the first African-American owned insurance company in the northern United States.  Since white-owned insurance firms regularly denied black customers life insurance when the firm was founded, the firm played an important role in providing life insurance to Chicago's African-American community.  The company ultimately became the largest African-American owned business in the northern states and became a symbol of the predominantly black Bronzeville neighborhood's economic success from the 1920s to the 1950s. \n\n712 5th Avenue is a 650 ft skyscraper at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue in the Midtown neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.  It was constructed from 1990 to 1991 and is the 53rd tallest building in New York City.  The tower's design had to accommodate the landmarked facades of the Coty and Rizzoli Buildings at the base of the tower.  It was purchased by the Bannister Trust in 2007 in a \"Private Treaty\", and placed in \"Property Fund #1\" managed by JP Morgan.  The building is sometimes referred to as the Henri Bendel building. \n\nMontreal's New York Life Insurance Building (also known as the Quebec Bank Building) is an office building at Place d'Armes in what is now known as Old Montreal, erected in 1887-1889.  At the time of its completion, it was the tallest commercial building in Montreal with the first eight floors were designed for retail office space, that quickly filled with the city's best lawyers and financiers.  When the clock tower was completed, the owner filled the ninth and tenth floors with the largest legal library in the entire country as a gift to tenants.  The building is next to another historic office tower, Aldred Building. \n\n",

He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. \n\nDouglas Erwin Bollinger (born 24 July 1981) is a professional Australian cricketer.  He has played first-class cricket for the New South Wales cricket team and international cricket for Australia.  He is a left-handed batsman and a left-arm fast bowler.  Bollinger has played for Worcestershire County Cricket Club and Kent County Cricket Club in England, for the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League and for Hobart Hurricanes, Sydney Thunder and Sydney Sixers in domestic T20 competition. \n\nIn 2013, Kent County Cricket Club competed in Division Two of the County Championship, Group A of the 40-over Yorkshire Bank 40 and the South Group of the Friends Life t20.  Kent also hosted a first-class match at the St Lawrence Ground against Cardiff MCCU at the start of the season and a T20 match against the touring New Zealanders in June.  It was the second season in charge for head coach Jimmy Adams.  The club captain was England spinner James Tredwell, taking over from Rob Key who had been club captain since 2006.  Brendan Nash registered as a Kolpak player, ending his West Indies international career, which allowed Kent to sign another overseas player.  South African fast bowler Vernon Philander filled this role, although he was only with the club for a short spell in July.  Another new addition to the squad was 22-year-old Calum Haggett from Somerset.  Shortly before the end of the season, Kent signed two young fast bowlers: Charlie Hartley and Matt Hunn (Matt Hunn made his debut in the final county championship match of 2013).  In addition, Mitchell Claydon joined on loan from Durham on 11 June initially for one month, but this was extended for a second month (he later signed on a permanent basis for 2014). \n\nDavid Andrew Griffiths (born 10 September 1985) is an English professional cricketer who most recently played for Kent County Cricket Club.  He is a right arm fast bowler who bats left-handed.  Before signing for Kent in 2014, Griffiths had previously played for Hampshire and represented England at under-19 level.  Griffiths' contract with Kent expired at the end of the 2016 and was not renewed by the county. \n\nThis is a list of Kent County Cricket Club captains.  Kent County Cricket Club was formed in 1842 and has played in the County Championship since its inception in 1890 and in List A cricket and Twenty20 cricket.  The first match in which Kent have a named captain indicated on scorecards available occurred on 26\u201327 June 1856 when the county played MCC at Gravesend.  South Norton captained the county on that occasion and throughout the period until 1870.  The first official captain of the club was Lord Harris, an influential figure in the development of Kent and English cricket, who was appointed to the role in 1875.  As of 2017 the current club captain is batsman Sam Northeast who was appointed at the end of September 2015. \n\nIn 2010, Kent County Cricket Club competed in Division One of the County Championship, Group C of the 40-over Clydesdale Bank 40 and the South Group of the Friends Provident t20.  Kent also hosted three-day first-class matches at the St Lawrence Ground against Loughborough MCCU and the touring Pakistanis.  It was the first season in charge for Director of Cricket Paul Farbrace.  The club captain was former England batsman Rob Key who had been club captain since 2006.  Kent's overseas players were South African fast bowler Makhaya Ntini until late May, and Sri Lankan leg-spinner Malinga Bandara for the rest of the season. \n\nArthur Fielder (19 July 1877 \u2013 30 August 1949) was an English professional cricketer who played as a fast bowler for Kent County Cricket Club and the England cricket team between 1900 and 1914.

He was chosen as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year in 1907. \n\nJohn Richard Mason (26 March 1874 \u2013 15 October 1958), known as Jack Mason, was an English amateur cricketer who played for England in five Test matches on A.E. Stoddart's 1897\u201398 tour of Australia.  A right-hand bat and right-arm fast-medium pace bowler, Mason played county cricket for Kent County Cricket Club between 1893 and 1914, captaining the side between 1898 and 1902.  With a height over six feet, and an attractive, elegantly straight play with the bat, Mason was considered \"one of the finest amateur allrounders to play for Kent\".  Mason was chosen as one of Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year in 1898. \n\nWayne Dillon Parnell (born 30 July 1989) is a South African cricketer who plays Test cricket, One Day International cricket and Twenty20 matches for South Africa.  At the domestic level he plays for Cape Cobras, having previously played for the Warriors and Eastern Province.

He was the son of Khosrau II (590\u2013628).  He became king after orchestrating a coup d'\u00e9tat against his father. \n\nSuintila, or \"Swinthila\", \"Svinthila\"; (ca. 588 \u2013 633/635) was Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania and Galicia from 621 to 631.  There was a new peace in the Kingdom of the Visigoths.  As a direct result, by 624 the king was able to retake those lands that had been under the control of the Byzantine Empire.  He was a son of Reccared I and wife Bado, and a brother of the general Geila. \n\nAshur-etil-ilani was a king of Assyria (c. 631 BC \u2013 c. 627 BC).  He succeeded his father Ashurbanipal. \n\nHormizd VI (Persian: \u0647\u0631\u0645\u0632\u200e \u200e ) was a Sasanian king of parts of Persia from 630 to 631.  He was one of the many pretenders who rose after the murder of Khosrau II (590\u2013628) in 628.  He maintained himself about two years (630\u2013632) in the district of Nisibis.  He was the grandson of Khosrau II. \n\nThe Duchy of Thuringia was an eastern frontier march of the Merovingian kingdom of Austrasia, established about 631 by King Dagobert I after his troops had been defeated by the forces of the Slavic confederation of Samo at the Battle of Wogastisburg.  It was recreated in the Carolingian Empire and its dukes appointed by the king until it was absorbed by the Saxon dukes in 908.  From about 1111/12 the territory was ruled by the Landgraves of Thuringia as Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. \n\nSamo founded the first recorded political union of Slavic tribes, known as Samo's Empire (\"realm\", \"kingdom\", or \"tribal union\"), stretching from Silesia to present-day Slovenia, ruling from 623 until his death in 658.  According to Fredegarius, the only contemporary source, Samo was a Frankish merchant who unified several Slavic tribes against robber raids and violence by nearby settled Avars, showing such bravery and command skills in battle that he was elected as the \"Slavic king\" (Latin: \"Rex Sclavorum\" ).  In 631, Samo successfully defended his realm against the Frankish Kingdom in the three-day Battle of Wogastisburg. \n\nChach (c. 631-711 CE) (Sindhi: \u0686\u0686\u200e ) was a Brahmin who reigned as king of Sindh in the mid-7th century CE.  A former prime minister to the king Rai Sahasi II, Chach ascended to the throne by marrying the king's widow.  The Brahmin dynasty under Chach expanded the kingdom of Sindh, and his successful efforts to subjugate surrounding monarchies and ethnic groups into an empire covering the entire Indus valley and beyond were recorded in the \"Chach Nama\". \n\nSamo's Empire is the historiographical name for the Slavic tribal union established by King (\"rex\") Samo, which existed between 631 and 658 A.D..  The centre of the union was most likely in Moravia, while the union included Silesia, Bohemia, Lusatia and Carantania. \n\nKhosrow IV was a Sasanian usurper who ruled briefly in 631.  Little is known about his rule, he appears to have ruled during a time of upheaval and chaos across the Sasanian Empire the 7th century has the century where Iran has plunged into its \"dark ages\".  He was the son of Mah-Adhur Gushnasp, who was the minister of the Sasanian Empire during the reign of Ardashir III, and Kahar-dukht, the daughter of Yazdandar, who was the son of Khosrau I.  His rule seems to coincide with other pretenders such as Hormizd VI so it is likely that he ruled a district or province rather than the Empire in its entirety.  He was killed after a few days of reign. \n\nFarrukhzad Khosrau V was briefly king of the Sasanian Empire from March 631 to April 631.  He was the son of Khosrau II. \n\n",

He has been played by actor Drake Hogestyn since 1986, with a break in between from January 2009 to September 2011.  John was created by script writers Sheri Anderson, Thom Racina and Leah Laiman as The Pawn in 1985 and introduced by executive producers Betty Corday and Al Rabin.  John becomes one of \"Days of Our Lives' \" most popular characters when he is revealed to be the presumed dead Roman Brady (Wayne Northrop) with plastic surgery and amnesia.  However, Northrop's return in 1991 led to Hogestyn's Roman being retconned into the entirely separate character of John Black, which also establishes the supercouple pairing of John and Marlena, due to John's affair with Roman's wife, Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall).  During the time in which he believes he is Roman, John picks up the mantle of Roman's feud with the notorious international criminal Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo).  John and Stefano's feud is central to the character's history as Stefano is partly responsible for John's memory loss.  Their lives are further intertwined in 2008 when the two are falsely led to believe they are half brothers\u2014a story that was later disproved.  Hogestyn's portrayal has made him one of daytime's most popular and recognizable stars.  Hogestyn was attributed with helping the series out of its ratings slump in the 1980s.

Phil is one of the major introductions made by executive producer Michael Ferguson, who wanted to bring in some macho, male leads.  Phil and his brother Grant became popularly known as the Mitchell brothers in the British media with Phil initially portrayed as the more level-headed of the two thugs.  Storylines featuring the Mitchell family dominated the soap opera throughout the 1990s, with Phil becoming a popular and long-running male protagonist into the 2000s and the 2010s.  McFadden temporarily left the series in late 2003 then returned in March 2005 for a short stint, before making a permanent return in October 2005.

A large part of the Kasi tribe live in the city of Quetta Balochistan, and Pakistan.  Another large part of the Kasi confederacy is known as Shinwari, mainly settled in the eastern valleys of Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan and around Landi Kotal in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Kohat District Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pakistan. \n\nProphetstown State Park, named after Tenskwatawa (\"The Prophet\"), a religious leader and younger brother of Shawnee leader Tecumseh, is located near the town of Battle Ground, Indiana, United States, about a mile east of the site of the Battle of Tippecanoe.  Established in 2004, it is Indiana\u2019s newest state park.  The park is home to the Museum at Prophetstown, which recreates a Native American village and a 1920s-era farm. \n\nTecumseh's Confederacy was a group of Native Americans in the Old Northwest that began to form in the early 19th century around the teaching of Tenskwatawa (The Prophet).  The confederation grew over several years and came to include several thousand warriors.  Shawnee leader Tecumseh, the brother of The Prophet, developed into the leader of the group as early as 1808.  Deemed a threat to the United States, a preemptive strike against the confederation was launched resulting in the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe.  Under Tecumseh's leadership, the confederation went to war with the United States during Tecumseh's War and the War of 1812.  Following the death of Tecumseh in 1813 the confederation fell apart. \n\nThe Battle of Tippecanoe ( ) was fought on November 7, 1811, in what is now Battle Ground, Indiana, between American forces led by Governor William Henry Harrison of the Indiana Territory and Native American warriors associated with the Shawnee leader Tecumseh.  Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa (commonly known as \"The Prophet\") were leaders of a confederacy of Native Americans from various tribes that opposed US expansion into Native territory.  As tensions and violence increased, Governor Harrison marched with an army of about 1,000 men to disperse the confederacy's headquarters at Prophetstown, near the confluence of the Tippecanoe and Wabash Rivers. \n\nThe following units of the U.S. Army and state militia forces under Indiana Governor William Henry Harrison, fought against the Native American warriors of Tecumseh's Confederacy, led by Chief Tecumseh's brother, Tenskwatawa \"The Prophet\" at the battle of Tippecanoe on November 7, 1811. \n\n\u1e92af\u0101r or Dhafar (Ar \u0638\u0641\u0627\u0631) \"\u00d0af\u0101r \" (museum: UTM: 435700E, 1571160 N zone 38P, 14\u00b012'N, 44\u00b024'E, deviating slightly from Google Earth) is an ancient Himyarite site situated in Yemen, some 130\u00a0km south-south-east of today's capital, Sana'a.  Given mention in several ancient texts, there is little doubt about the pronunciation of the name.  Despite the opinion of local patriots in Oman, this site in the Yemen is far older than its namesake there.  It lies in the Yemenite highlands at some 2800 m.  The closest large town is Yarim, which is 10\u00a0km directly to the north-north-west.  Zafar was the capital of the Himyarites (110 BCE - 525 CE), which at its peak ruled most of the Arabia.  The Himyar are not a tribe, but rather a tribal confederacy.  For 250 years the confederacy and its allies combined territory extended past Riyadh to the north and the Euphrates to the north-east.  Zafar was the Himyarite capital in Southern Arabia prior to the Aksumite conquest. \n\nZiri ibn Atiyya (Berber language: Ziri n \u0190a\u1e6diyya Ame\u0263raw) also known as Ziri ibn Atiyya ibn Abd Allah ibn Tab\u0101dalt ibn Muhammad ibn Khazar az-Zan\u0101t\u012b al-Maghr\u0101w\u012b al-Khazar\u012b (died 1001) was the first tribal leader of the Berber Maghrawa tribal confederacy and kingdom. \n\nThe Battle of Fallen Timbers (August 20, 1794) was the final battle of the Northwest Indian War, a struggle between Native American tribes affiliated with the Western Confederacy, including support from the British led by Captain Alexander McKillop, against the United States for control of the Northwest Territory (an area north of the Ohio River, east of the Mississippi River, and southwest of the Great Lakes).  This land had been ceded to the United States in accordance with the Treaty of Paris (1783), but the Native Americans (who had not been party to the treaty) refused to comply with the treaty and relinquish control.  British army bases were maintained there to support their Native allies.  This ultimately led to the American offensive and subsequent British-Indian withdrawal from the territory altogether following the Treaty of Greenville.  The battle, which was a decisive victory for the United States, ended major hostilities in the region until Tecumseh's War and the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. \n\nNative American Shawnee warrior and chief, who became the primary leader of a large, multi-tribal confederacy in the early years of the nineteenth century.  Born in the Ohio Country (present-day Ohio), and growing up during the American Revolutionary War and the Northwest Indian War, Tecumseh was exposed to warfare and envisioned the establishment of an independent Indian nation east of the Mississippi River under British protection and worked to recruit additional members to his tribal confederacy from the southern United States. \n\nTenskwatawa (also called Tenskatawa, Tenskwatawah, Tensquatawa or Lalawethika) (January 1775\u00a0\u2013 November 1836) was a Native American religious and political leader of the Shawnee tribe, known as the Prophet or the Shawnee Prophet.  He was a younger brother of Tecumseh, leader of the Shawnee.  In his early years Tenskwatawa was given the name Lalawethika (\"He Makes a Loud Noise\" or \"The Noise Maker\"), but he changed it around 1805 and transformed himself from a hapless, alcoholic youth into an influential spiritual leader.  Tenskwatawa denounced the Americans, calling them the offspring of the Evil Spirit, and lead a purification movement that promoted unity among the American Indians, rejected acculturation to the American way of life, and encouraged his followers to pursue traditional ways. \n\n",

        "context": "People of Irish descent form the largest single ethnic group in Boston, Massachusetts.  Once a Puritan stronghold, Boston changed dramatically in the 19th century with the arrival of European immigrants.  The Irish dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period, especially following the Great Irish Famine.  Their arrival transformed Boston from an Anglo-Saxon, Protestant city into one that has become progressively more diverse.  The Yankees hired Irish as workers and servants, but there was little social interaction.  In the 1840s and 50s, the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant Know-Nothing movement targeted Irish Catholics in Boston.  In the 1860s, many Irish immigrants fought for the Union in the American Civil War, and that display of patriotism helped to dispel some of the prejudice against them. \n\nThe Pinpu tribe peoples, also called the Pepo or Plains tribes, are peoples that mainly settled in the western plains of Taiwan.  They led a primitive agricultural life before the mass arrival of Han immigrants.  Since the 17th century, they have faced the strong forces from outside, such as the Dutch, the Spanish, and the Han Chinese, and they have failed to resist their fate to be assimilated.  By the end of 19th century, most Pingpu tribes had been almost completely Hanised (hanhua), and they have lost their languages and cultures.  They have become an invisible ethnic group in a society highly dominated by the Han Chinese.  During the period of Japanese rule, Japanese scholars conducted investigations and research on the Plains tribes based on anthropology and ethnology.  The present categorization of the Plains tribes has resulted from their thorough study as the following: \n\nAfrican Bermudians or Bermudians of African descent are Bermudians whose ancestry lies within the continent of Africa.  The population descented from Black Africans, exported to Bermuda as slaves.  Some Black Bermudians were Free Blacks who chose to immigrate to the island to work as indentured servants during the 17th century.  By the 19th century the Black population surpassed the White population and became Bermuda's largest ethnic group, which was initially classed as being \"Coloured\" alongside all other non-white ethnicities of Bermuda.  \"Black Bermudian\" became a recognised ethnic group in Bermuda in the 20th century, by which time it was the largest ethnic group on the island. \n\nThe Oku people, also commonly known as Oku Mohammedans or \"Aku Mohammedans\"in Sierra Leone and as the \"Aku Marabou\" or \"Oku Marabou\" in the Gambia, are an ethnic group in Sierra Leone and the Gambia.  The Oku people are the descendants of liberated Africans of Yoruba descent from Southwest Nigeria who were liberated or came to Sierra Leone as settlers in the mid 19th century and formed a distinctive ethnic group The Oku are virtually all Muslims and are known for their conservative muslim population.  The British colonial government provided official recognition to the Oku Mohammedan community as a distinctive community in Sierra Leone.  Although the Sierra Leone government officially considered the Oku people as members of the Creole ethnic group, many Sierra Leoneans consider the Oku people as a distinctive ethnic group. \n\nCzechs in Ukraine, often known as Volhynian Czechs (Czech: \"Voly\u0148\u0161t\u00ed \u010ce\u0161i\"), are ethnic Czechs or their descendants settled mostly in the Volhynia region of Ukraine, in the second half of the 19th century.  Between 1868 and 1880, almost 16,000 Czechs left Austria-Hungary for Tsarist Russia.  The reasons for their departure were the difficult living conditions in the Czech lands, and the rumors of prosperity in the Russian realm, where there was a large amount of unused agricultural land.  The local government in the region attracted new immigrants with a number of advantages, such as the right to purchase their own land for low prices, and the establishment of manufacturing businesses.  Also, they gave the migrants the right to national education, self-government and religious freedom.  Immigrants were exempt for 20 years from tax, and exonerated from military duty.  The bulk of the Czechs settled in the regions of Volhynia, Zhytomyr, Lutsk and other areas.  Some villages were set up in flat meadows, while others were located near existing Ukrainian villages.  Local Czech naems for the villages they lived in were formed from the original name of the village, which was supplemented with the word \"Czech\" (eg \u010cesk\u00e9 Noviny, \u010cesk\u00fd Mal\u00edn, \u010cesk\u00fd Borat\u00edn, \u010cesk\u00fd Straklov, etc.) Apart from agriculture, Czech immigrants began to engage in other activities, such as industry, trade and crafts.  The income for most ethnic Czechs had its foundations in the engineering, breweries, mills, cement plants, etc.  In their communities, schools, churches, and libraries were founded, and because of this, cultural and social life flourished.  Czech immigrants have made a major contribution to increasing the economic and cultural level in the built-up areas. \n\nThe Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) is an Irish Catholic fraternal organisation.  Members must be Catholic and either born in Ireland or of Irish descent.  Its largest membership is now in the United States, where it was founded in New York City in 1836.  Its name was adopted by groups of Irish immigrants in the United States, its purpose to act as guards to protect Catholic churches from anti-Catholic forces in the mid-19th century, and to assist Irish Catholic immigrants, especially those who faced discrimination or harsh coal mining working conditions.  Many members in the coal mining area of Pennsylvania had a background with the Molly Maguires.  It became an important focus of Irish American political activity. \n\nThe Shiners' War was a conflict between Irish Catholic immigrants and French Canadians in Bytown from 1835 to 1845.  The war started when Peter Aylen, a major Irish timber operator, organized a group of Irishmen to attack other timber operations.  This group was known as the \"Shiners.\"  They attacked French Canadian timber rafts and fought against the French Canadian on the streets of Bytown. \n\nIrish Canadians (Irish: \"Gaedheal-Cheanadaigh\" ) are Canadian citizens who have full or partial Irish heritage including descendants who trace their ancestry to immigrants who originated in Ireland.  1.2 million Irish immigrants arrived from 1825 to 1970, and at least half of those in the period from 1831\u20131850.  By 1867, they were the second largest ethnic group (after the French), and comprised 24% of Canada's population.  The 1931 national census counted 1,230,000 Canadians of Irish descent, half of whom lived in Ontario.  About one-third were Catholic in 1931 and two-thirds Protestant. \n\nPeople of Irish descent form the largest ethnic group in the city of Philadelphia and its surrounding counties.  The Irish have lived in Philadelphia since the pre-American Revolution period.  Irishmen had participated in pro-Revolutionary activities in Philadelphia during the Revolutionary War.  Like many American cities in the 19th century, Philadelphia, which was once a Quaker stronghold, changed dramatically with the influx of European immigrants.  The first major influx of Irish came in 1844 from rural areas, spurred by the Irish Famine.  Because of the Quakers belief and pledge of religious tolerance, Irish Catholics and Protestants, amongst others, made the city incredibly diverse.  Philadelphia at the time had a need for industrial labor, and at the time Philadelphia was becoming a major industrial center in the United States.  Irish took industrial positions.  In the 1840s and 1850s, anti-Catholic sentiment grew against the Irish, and eventually led up to riots, such as the Philadelphia nativist riots and the Lombard Street riot.  Eventually the Irish gained financial and social status in the latter half of the 19th Century and founded institutions during the period. \n\nAmerico-Liberians, or the Congo people in Liberian English, are a Liberian ethnicity of African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and liberated African descent.  The sister ethnic group of Americo-Liberians are the Sierra Leone Creole people, who shared similar ancestry and related culture.  Americo-Liberians trace their ancestry to free-born and formerly enslaved African Americans who immigrated in the 19th century to become the founders of the state of Liberia.  They identified there as Americo Liberians.  (Some African Americans, following resettlement in Canada, also participated as founding settlers in Sierra Leone and present-day C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.)  Although the terms \"Americo-Liberian\" and \"Congo\" had distinct definitions in the nineteenth century, the terms \"Americo-Liberian\" and \"Congo\" are currently interchangeable and refer to an ethnic group composed of the descendants of the various free and ex-slave African American, Caribbean, Recaptive, and Sierra Leone Creoles who settled in Liberia from 1822. \n\n",

        "context": "A Thing of Beauty is a novel by author A. J. Cronin, initially published in 1956, with the alternate title of \"Crusader's Tomb\".  It tells the story of Stephen Desmonde, an English painter who struggles for recognition in a conventional world, sacrificing everything for his passion for art.  The title is a reference to John Keats' 1818 poem, \"Endymion\", which begins with \"A thing of beauty is a joy for ever.\" \n\nWho Goes There?  is a collection of science fiction stories by author John W. Campbell, Jr..  It was published in 1948 by Shasta Publishers in an edition of 3,000 copies, of which 200 were signed by Campbell.  The 1951 film, \"The Thing from Another World\", and 1982 version \"The Thing\" by John Carpenter, are based on the title story.  The stories originally appeared in the magazine \"Astounding\" under Campbell's pseudonym Don A. Stuart. \n\nJoshua D. Zimmerman (born 1966) is Professor of History at Yeshiva University, where he holds the Eli and Diana Zborowski Professorial Chair in Interdisciplinary Holocaust Studies.  He is the author of \"The Polish Underground and the Jews, 1939-1945\" by Cambridge University Press (2015, hardback) and of \"Contested Memories.  Poles and Jews during the Holocaust and Its Aftermath\" by Rutgers University Press (2003, hardcover) as well as \"Poles, Jews and the Politics of Nationality: The Jewish Labor Bund and the Polish Socialist Party in Late Czarist Russia, 1892\u20131914.\" <ref name=\"yu.edu/faculty\"> </ref> Zimmerman graduated from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1989 with a BA(Hons) in History, and with the M.A. in History from UCLA in 1993.  In February 1998 he completed his PhD thesis in Comparative History at Brandeis University, and in the summer 2004 was appointed to the position of Associate Professor of History at Yeshiva University in New York City.  Zimmerman is an American author proficient in Yiddish, Polish, Hebrew, Russian, and French. <ref name=\"yu.edu/cv\"> </ref> \n\nThe Patrick Kavanagh Poetry Award is an Irish poetry award for a collection of poems by an author who has not previously been published in collected form.  It is confined to poets born on the island of Ireland, or of Irish nationality, or a long-term resident of Ireland.  It is based on an open competition whose closing date is in July each year.  The award was founded by the Patrick Kavanagh Society in 1971 to commemorate the poet. \n\nMarta Vergara Varas (1898\u20131995) was a Chilean author, editor, journalist and women's rights activist.  Introduced to international feminism in 1930, she became instrumental in the development of the Inter-American Commission of Women (CIM) helping gather documentation on laws which effected women's nationality.  She pushed Doris Stevens to broaden the scope of international feminism to include working women's issues in the quest for equality.  A founding member of the Pro-Emancipation Movement of Chilean Women (Spanish: \"Movimiento Pro-Emancipaci\u00f3n de las Mujeres de Chile (MEMCh)\" ), she was editor of its monthly bulletin \"La Mujer Nueva\".  When she was ousted from the Communist Party she moved to Europe and worked as a journalist during the war.  At war's end, she returned to Washington, D.C. and worked at the CIM continuing to press for women's suffrage and equality, before returning to Chile, where she resumed her writing career. \n\n\u201cThe Most Incredible Thing\" (Danish: \"Det Utroligste\" ) is a literary fairy tale by Danish poet and author Hans Christian Andersen (1805\u20131875).  The story is about a contest to find the most incredible thing and the wondrous consequences when the winner is chosen.  The tale was first published in an English translation by Horace Scudder, an American correspondent of Andersen's, in the United States in September 1870 before being published in the original Danish in Denmark in October 1870.  \"The Most Incredible Thing\" was the first of Andersen's tales to be published in Denmark during World War II.  Andersen considered the tale one of his best. \n\nAustralian Property Law is the system of laws regulating and prioritising the rights, interests and responsibilities of individuals in relation to \"things\".  These things are a form of \"property\" or \"right\" to possession or ownership of an object.  The law orders or prioritises rights and classifies property as either real and tangible, such as land, or intangible, such as the right of an author to their literary works or personal but tangible, such as a book or a pencil.  The scope of what constitutes a thing capable of being classified as property and when an individual or body corporate gains priority of interest over a thing has in legal scholarship been heavily debated on a philosophical level. \n\nCreationism (Spanish: creacionismo ) was a literary movement initiated by Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro around 1912.  Creationism is based on the idea of a poem as a truly \"new\" thing, created by the author for the sake of itself\u2014that is, not to praise another thing, not to please the reader, not even to be understood by its own author. \n\nThe Viola Concerto by William Walton was written in 1929 for the violist Lionel Tertis at the suggestion of Sir Thomas Beecham.  The concerto carries the dedication \"To Christabel\" (Christabel McLaren, Lady Aberconway).  But Tertis rejected the manuscript, and composer and violist Paul Hindemith gave the first performance.  The work was greeted with enthusiasm.  It brought Walton to the forefront of British classical music.  In \"The Manchester Guardian\", Eric Blom wrote, \"This young composer is a born genius\" and said that it was tempting to call the concerto the best thing in recent music of any nationality.  Tertis soon changed his mind and took the work up. \n\nThe Man Booker International Prize is an international hosted in the United Kingdom.  The introduction of the International Prize to complement the Man Booker Prize was announced in June 2004.  Sponsored by the Man Group, from 2005 until 2015 the award was given every two years to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation.  It rewarded one author's \"continued creativity, development and overall contribution to fiction on the world stage\", and was a recognition of the writer's body of work rather than any one title.  The judges for the year compiled their own lists of authors, and submissions were not invited. \n\n",

Gryt\u00f8ya and Bjark\u00f8ya will be connected by a subsea road tunnel and a bridge will connect Gryt\u00f8ya and Sands\u00f8ya.  The tunnel to Bjark\u00f8ya will be 3.25 km long.  The bridge to Gryt\u00f8ya would be 300 m long plus a 900 m long causeway.  The project also includes 3 km of road on Gryt\u00f8ya to connect the existing roads to the new undersea tunnel.  The Bjark\u00f8y Tunnel will be part of Norwegian County Road 867, while the Sands\u00f8ya Bridge will be part of Norwegian County Road 124. \n\nThe \u00d8resund/\u00d6resund/Oresund Bridge (Danish: \"\u00d8resundsbroen\" , ] ; Swedish: \"\u00d6resundsbron\" , ] ; hybrid name: \"\u00d8resundsbron \") is a combined railway and motorway bridge across the \u00d8resund strait between Sweden and Denmark.  The bridge runs nearly 8 km from the Swedish coast to the artificial island Peberholm in the middle of the strait.  The crossing is completed by the 4 km Drogden Tunnel from Peberholm to the Danish island of Amager. \n\nSweden (Swedish: \"Sverige\" ), officially the Kingdom of Sweden, is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.  It borders Norway to the west and north and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the \u00d6resund.  At 450295 km2 Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area.  Sweden has a total population of 10.0 million of which 2.3 million has a foreign background.  It has a low population density of 22 PD/km2 ; the highest concentration is in the southern half of the country.  Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas. \n\n\u00d8resund or \u00d6resund (Danish: \"\u00d8resund\" , ] ; Swedish: \"\u00d6resund\" , ] ), commonly known in English as the Sound, is a strait which forms the Danish\u2013Swedish border, separating Sj\u00e6lland (Denmark) from Sk\u00e5ne (Sweden).  The strait has a length of 118 km and the width varies from 4 km to 28 km .  It is 4 km wide at its narrowest point between Helsing\u00f8r in Denmark and Helsingborg in Sweden. \n\nMalm\u00f6 Harbour Heliport (IATA: JMM,\u00a0ICAO: ESHM) , is an heliport serving Malm\u00f6, Sweden.  Before the \u00d6resund Bridge was opened in 2000 and before Sweden entered the Schengen Area in 2001, Malm\u00f6 Harbour Heliport and port had passport and customs check, and there were helicopter and speedboat connections directly to Copenhagen Airport transfer area. \n\nThe \u00d6resund Committee (Swedish: \"\u00d6resundskomiteen\" ) was an organisation which described itself as a platform for regional political collaboration in the \u00d6resund region.  The \u00d6resund region comprises Sweden's most southerly province of Sk\u00e5ne and the Danish islands of Zealand, Lolland, Falster and Bornholm.  The \u00d6resund region has a total population of 3.7 million inhabitants. \n\nThe \u00d8resund or \u00d6resund Region (Danish: \"\u00d8resundsregionen\" ; Swedish: \"\u00d6resundsregionen\" ] ) is a transnational metropolitan area in northern Europe, centred around the \u00d8resund strait and the two cities which lie on either side, Copenhagen, Denmark and Malm\u00f6, Sweden.  The region is connected by the \u00d8resund Bridge, which spans the strait at its southern end, and the HH Ferry route between Elsinore, Denmark (Danish: \"Helsing\u00f8r\") and Helsingborg, Sweden at the narrowest point of the strait. \n\nThe City Tunnel (Swedish: \"Citytunneln\" ) is a 17-kilometre rail link in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, running between Malm\u00f6 Central Station (Malm\u00f6 C) and the \u00d6resund Line (\u00d6resund Bridge), of which six kilometres under Malm\u00f6 city centre is in tunnel, to increase capacity on the Scanian network by changing Malm\u00f6 C from a terminus to a through station.  The work was projected to cost 9.45 billion SEK.  Under construction since March 2005, the line was inaugurated by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden on December 4, 2010, and revenue service commenced on December 12, 2010. \n\nCopenhagen Malm\u00f6 Port AB (CMP) operates the ports in Denmark's capital Copenhagen and in Sweden's third largest city, Malm\u00f6.  The ports are located either side of \u00d8resund, a strait between the two countries.  The combined \u00d8resund Region is the Nordic countries' largest metropolitan area in terms of population.  The region is connected by the \u00d8resund Bridge, which spans the strait at its southern end, and the HH Ferry route between Helsing\u00f8r, Denmark and Helsingborg, Sweden. \n\nEuropean route E\u00a047 is a highway going from L\u00fcbeck in Germany via Copenhagen, Denmark to Helsingborg, Sweden, which is also known under the name Vogelfluglinie and Sydmotorvejen.  The road has motorway standard all the way except for 28 km in Germany, the part inside Helsing\u00f8r (6\u00a0km/4 miles city street), and there are also two ferry connections.  The route has a ferry connection between Germany and Denmark.  A fixed link is planned there by the year 2020.  The discussion of a bridge or tunnel was settled when the 'Danish parliament rejected plans for a bridge across the Fehmarn Strait in favour of the tunnel, deciding it would be safer and greener'.  Also, there is a ferry connection between Denmark (Helsing\u00f8r) and Sweden (Helsingborg).  There is a bridge-tunnel combination between Denmark and Sweden further south, but still the ferry Helsing\u00f8r-Helsingborg has a dense schedule. \n\n",

        "context": "A fire regime is the pattern, frequency, and intensity of the bushfires and wildfires that prevail in an area over long periods of time.  It is an integral part of fire ecology, and renewal for certain types of ecosystems.  If fires are too frequent, plants may be killed before they have matured, or before they have set sufficient seed to ensure population recovery.  If fires are too infrequent, plants may mature, senesce, and die without ever releasing their seed.  Fire is a type of disturbance regime that can define an ecosystem.  Disturbance regimes like fire can change soil erosion, soil formation, nutrient cycles, energy flow, and other ecosystem characteristics.  Disruption of an ecosystem can allow changes in species dominance and mutations in individual species.  Fire regimes can change with the spatial and temporal variations in topography, climate, and fuel. \n\nA fen is one of the main types of wetland, the others being grassy marshes, forested swamps, and peaty bogs. Along with bogs, fens are a kind of mire.  Fens are minerotrophic peatlands, usually fed by mineral-rich surface water or groundwater.  They are characterised by their distinct water chemistry, which is pH neutral or alkaline, with relatively high dissolved mineral levels but few other plant nutrients.  They are usually dominated by grasses and sedges, and typically have brown mosses in general including \"Scorpidium\" or \"Drepanocladus\".  Fens frequently have a high diversity of other plant species including carnivorous plants such as \"Pinguicula\".  They may also occur along large lakes and rivers where seasonal changes in water level maintain wet soils with few woody plants.  The distribution of individual species of fen plants is often closely connected to water regimes and nutrient concentrations. \n\nMarsilea minuta, or dwarf waterclover is a species of aquatic fern in the Marsileaceae family.  Not to be confused with \"Marsilea minuta\" , which is a synonym for \"Marsilea vestita\".  Other common names include gelid waterklawer, small water clover, airy pepperwort, and pepperwort, though the lattermost also applies to plants in the genus Lepidium.  In French it is called \n\nAraripesuchus is an extinct genus of notosuchian crocodyliform that lived in Gondwana during the Cretaceous Period.  The genus includes at least five species found throughout Western Africa and South America.  The relationship of the individual species within this genus is hotly debated, specifically, the placement of Araripesuchus wegeneri.  \"A. wegeneri\" is a small bodied crocodyliform characterized by relatively elongate limbs, an upright gait, and marked heterodonty.  The tooth morphology, when combined with tooth wear and orientation, suggests that this animal may have been an omnivore or herbivore.  Additionally, the gracile limbs and their orientation imply that this was a terrestrial animal.  These features demonstrate that \"Araripesuchus wegeneri\" stands in stark contrast to its modern-day relatives, crocodiles and alligators. \n\nThe Marsileaceae are a small family of heterosporous aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns, though at first sight they do not physically resemble other ferns.  The group is commonly known as the \"pepperwort family\" or as the \"water-clover family\" because the leaves of the genus \"Marsilea\" superficially resemble the leaves of a four-leaf clover (a flowering plant).  Leaves of this fern have sometimes been used to substitute for clover leaves on Saint Patrick's Day.  In all, the family contains 3 genera and 50 to 80 species with most of those belonging to \"Marsilea\". \n\nBrabejum is a genus of a single species of large evergreen tree, Brabejum stellatifolium in the Proteaceae, commonly called wild almond, bitter almond or ghoeboontjie.  It is restricted in the wild to South Africa's Western Cape Province, where it grows in thickets along the banks of streams.  The plant is of botanical interest as being Africa's only member of the large grevilleoid subfamily.  It is a bushy small tree with branches widely at ground level and numerous erect vigorous stems.  Leaves to 6 in (15 cm) long, narrow and bluntly toothed, appear at intervals along the branches, mostly in whorls of 6.  In summer, the plant bears white flowers densely crowded on spikes arising from rusty buds at the leaf axils.  The fruits to 2 in (5 cm) long, magenta to reddish brown, similar to an almond, appear in autumn.  The nut is too bitter to eat; however, in earlier times it was boiled, roasted, and ground to make a \"coffee\" drink. \n\nLeptospermum is a genus of shrubs and small trees in the myrtle family Myrtaceae commonly known as tea trees, although this name is sometimes also used for some species of \"Melaleuca\".  Most species are endemic to Australia, with the greatest diversity in the south of the continent but some are native to other parts of the world, including New Zealand and Southeast Asia.  Leptospermums all have five conspicuous petals and five groups of stamens which alternate with the petals.  There is a single style in the centre of the flower and the fruit is a woody capsule.  The first formal description of a leptospermum was published in 1776 by the German botanists Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Johann Georg Adam Forster, but an unambiguous definition of individual species in the genus was not achieved until 1979.  Leptospermums grow in a wide range of habitats but are most commonly found in moist, low-nutrient soils.  They have important uses in horticulture, in the production of honey and in floristry. \n\nMyiodynastes is a genus of birds in the family Tyrannidae.  Created by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1857, the genus contains five species which are collectively referred to as \"sulphur-bellied flycatchers\"; that name is also given to one of the individual species in the genus.  The genus name \"Myiodynastes\" is a compound word composed from two Greek words: \"muia\", meaning \"fly\" and \"dunast\u1ebds\", meaning \"ruler\". \n\nSinocyclocheilus is a genus of freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae endemic to China, where only found in Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan.  Almost all of its species live in or around caves and most of these have adaptions typical of cavefish such as a lack of scales, lack of pigmentation and reduced eyes (some are completely blind).  Several species have an unusual hunchbacked appearance and some of the cave-dwellers have a \"horn\" on the back (above the forehead), the function of which is unclear.  In contrast, the \"Sinocyclocheilus\" species that live aboveground, as well as a few found underground, show no clear cavefish adaptions.  They are relatively small fish reaching up to 23 cm in length.  The individual species have small ranges and populations, leading to the status of most of the evaluated species as threatened.  Many species populations in the genus have yet to be evaluated. \n\nThe Be'er Sheva fringe-fingered lizard (\"Acanthodactylus beershebensis\") is a species of lizard in the Lacertidae family.  It is a member of the subgenus Lacertinae, and the tribe Acanthodactylus (spiny footed lizards).  Considered a separate species based on morphological distinction, and isolated location; it shares a large portion of its genetics with \"Acanthodactylus pardalis\" in this genus.  Many of the individual species under this genus are similar, but varying coloration explains why each species have been separated.  Like all \"Acanthodactylus\", the beershebensis lays eggs, varying from three to seven eggs at a time.  Adults vary in size from 17 to 20 centimeters, but can get much larger.  It is endemic to the loess scrublands of the Negev desert in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, a biodiversity hotspot. \n\n",

        "context": "Blackman-Bosworth Store, also known as Bosworth Store Building, S.N. Bosworth's Cheap Cash Store, David Blackman's Store, and Randolph County Museum, is a historic general store located at Beverly, Randolph County, West Virginia, United States.  It consists of the original section, built about 1828, with an addition built in 1894.  The original section is a two-story brick building on a cut-stone foundation.  In addition to being operated as a general store into the 1920s, the building had short-term use as county courthouse, post office and semi-official meeting place.  In 1973, the Randolph County Historical Society purchased the property, and it now serves as the Randolph County Museum and as a meeting place. \n\nThe Grange Hall in Somerset Township, Jackson County, Illinois, is the historic meeting place of Somerset Township's chapter of The Grange.  Built in 1912, the building was Somerset Grange #1553's second meeting hall; the first building was built in 1876 and burned down in 1909.  The red brick building was built by contractor W. A. Pitman in the Commercial style.  The Grange Hall served as a meeting place for local farmers to discuss agricultural affairs and propose farm policy to legislators.  The National Farmers Union's newspaper, the \"Union Farmer\", was published from the Somerset Grange Hall until 1914.  The building also served as a local social center and hosted township elections, club meetings, and community events.  The hall was rehabilitated in 1988; it still serves as a township polling place. \n\nSt James's Palace is the most senior royal palace in the United Kingdom.  Located in the City of Westminster, although no longer the principal residence of the monarch, it is the ceremonial meeting place of the Accession Council and the London residence of several members of the royal family. \n\nIn the Canadian cabinet, the President of The Queen's Privy Council for Canada (French: \"President du Conseil priv\u00e9 de la Reine pour le Canada\" ) is nominally in charge of the Privy Council Office.  The President of the Privy Council also has the largely ceremonial duty of presiding over meetings of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, a body which only convenes in full for affairs of state such as the accession of a new Sovereign or the marriage of the Prince of Wales or heir presumptive to the Throne (see Monarchy in Canada).  Accordingly, the last time the President of the Privy Council had to preside over a meeting of the Privy Council was in 1981 on the occasion of Charles, Prince of Wales' engagement to Lady Diana Spencer.  It is the equivalent of the office of Lord President of the Council in the United Kingdom. \n\nThe original Brady Hotel, a three-story wood frame building, was built in 1903 at Archer and North Main in Tulsa, Oklahoma by W. Tate Brady.  It was the first hotel in Tulsa with baths, conveniently located to the Frisco railroad depot, and very popular among the oil men attracted by the new oil discoveries at Glen Pool.  This was also the meeting place where Charles N. Haskell announced his candidacy to become the first governor of the new state of Oklahoma.  It also served as a meeting place for Democrats, who laid the groundwork to control the Constitutional Convention and maintain segregation. \n\nWarriparinga (meaning \"Windy Place\" in the local Kaurna language) is a nature reserve comprising 3.5 ha in the metropolitan suburb of Bedford Park, in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia.  It has historical, cultural and environmental significance as a traditional Kaurna ceremonial meeting place and as a site of early European settlement.  Also known as Fairford, Laffer's Triangle and the Sturt Triangle, Warriparinga is bordered by Marion Road, Sturt Road and South Road, and is traversed by the Sturt River as it exists from Sturt Gorge to travel west across the Adelaide Plains. \n\nThe Great Hall of the People is a state building located at the western edge of Tiananmen Square in Beijing.  It is used for legislative and ceremonial activities by the People's Republic of China (PRC) government and the ruling Communist Party of China.  The Great Hall functions as the meeting place for the full sessions of the Chinese parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), which occurs every year during March along with the national session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a political advisory body.  It is also the meeting place of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which, since 1982, has occurred once every five years. \n\nThe Pollokshields Burgh Hall stands at the edge of Maxwell Park, Glasgow, Scotland.  Designed by Henry Edward Clifford and constructed in 17th-century Scottish Baronial style, this was opened in 1890 by Sir John Stirling Maxwell as a Masonic Meeting Place and for the use of the community but served the independent burgh of Pollokshields only until 1891 when the rapidly expanding city swallowed up the area.  The hall contained various council offices and a courtroom.  It continues to this day as a Masonic meeting place, hence the numerous Masonic symbols in the carvings (especially at the back of the building) and in the stained-glass windows. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Accession Council is a ceremonial body which assembles in St James's Palace upon the death of a monarch (Demise of the Crown), to formally proclaim the accession of his or her successor to the throne.  Under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701, a new monarch succeeds automatically.  The proclamation confirms by name the identity of the heir who has succeeded. \n\nCrowther Masonic Hall or Freemasons' Hall in Kollam is a part of the Grand Lodge of India and it was a meeting place for many Masonic Lodges in the Quilon(Kollam) area.  It is near Kochupilamoodu in Kollam city and has been a Masonic meeting place since 1806.  The building is now considered as a historic monument of Freemasonry activities in ancient Travancore area. \n\n",

In 1904, a royal charter, created in 1903, was granted to the University of Leeds by King Edward VII. \n\nThe East Riding of Yorkshire is a local government district with unitary authority status, and is a ceremonial county of England.  It is named after the historic East Riding of Yorkshire which was one of three ridings alongside the North Riding and West Riding, which were constituent parts a Yorkshire ceremonial and administrative county until 1974.  From 1974 to 1996 the area of the modern East Riding of Yorkshire constituted the northern part of Humberside. \n\nBedale is a market town and civil parish in the district of Hambleton, North Yorkshire, England.  Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, it is situated 34 mi north of Leeds, 26 mi south-west of Middlesbrough and 7 mi south-west of the county town of Northallerton.  It was originally in Richmondshire and listed in the \"Domesday Book\" as part of Catterick wapentake, which was also known as Hangshire (so named from Hang Bank in Finghall and because of the many gallows used to execute marauding Scots); it was split again and Bedale remained in East Hang.  Bedale Beck is a tributary of the River Swale, which forms one of the Yorkshire Dales, with its predominance of agriculture and its related small traditional trades, although tourism is increasingly important. \n\nThe Nidderdale Museum is housed in a former workhouse in the market town of Pateley Bridge, North Yorkshire, England.

Yardley was named Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1948 and in his obituary in \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", he was described as Yorkshire's finest amateur since Stanley Jackson. \n\nMaurice Ward was an English inventor best known for his invention of Starlite, a thermal shielding material.  He was a former hairdresser from Yorkshire, England.  His demand that he keep 51% ownership of the formula for Starlite, and belief that the technology was worth billions of dollars, stunted its commercial success. \n\nThe West Yorkshire Association Football League is a football competition based in Yorkshire, England.  It was previously known as the Leeds League until the name change in 1939.  Although it is named the \"West Yorkshire\" League, clubs from the Harrogate and York areas of North Yorkshire also play in the competition. \n\nStarlite is a material claimed to be able to withstand and insulate from extreme heat.  It was invented by amateur chemist and hairdresser Maurice Ward (1933\u20132011) during the 1970s and 1980s, and received much publicity in 1993 thanks to coverage on the science and technology show \"Tomorrow's World\".

Today, S\u00e3o Paulo is a city of low buildings, which rarely reach more than 80 meters and are mostly residential in nature.  Municipal laws limit the construction of large skyscrapers and the tallest skyscrapers are located in three different regions.  The city's financial center, fully occupied by skyscrapers, has moved.  The city of S\u00e3o Paulo has the 10th highest number of buildings in the world taller than 90 meters, behind Hong Kong, New York City, Tokyo, Shanghai, Bangkok, Guangzhou, Chicago, and Singapore, respectively. \n\nRaffles Place MRT Station (NS26/EW14) is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) cross-platform interchange station on the North South Line and the East West Line in Downtown Core, Singapore.

Nelson, 291 Minn. 310, 191 N.W.2d 185 (1971) is a case in which the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a state law limiting marriage to persons of the opposite sex did not violate the U.S. Constitution.  Baker appealed, and on October 10, 1972, the United States Supreme Court dismissed the appeal \"for want of a substantial federal question.\"  Because the case came to the U.S. Supreme Court through mandatory appellate review (not \"certiorari\"), the dismissal constituted a decision on the merits and established \"Baker v. Nelson\" as precedent, though the extent of its precedential effect had been subject to debate.  In May 2013, Minnesota legalized same-sex marriage and it took effect on August 1, 2013.  Subsequently, on June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court explicitly overruled \"Baker\" in \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" making same-sex marriage legal nationwide. \n\nUnited States v. Binion, 132 F. App'x 89 (8th Cir.  2005), is a case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit applied two recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions (\"United States v. Booker\", 543 U.S. 220 (2005) and \"United States v. Fanfan\", 543 U.S. 220 (2005) in reviewing the sentencing decision by the trial court and upheld by the Federal District Court for the Eastern District. \n\nLau Kong Yung v. Director of Immigration was a 1999 right of abode case in the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal following closely on the heels of the landmark \"Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration\" decision earlier that year.  After \"Ng\" and the two prior actions in \"Lau\", but before the case came before the CFA, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) of the People's Republic of China issued an interpretation of the Basic Law which affected the rights of Lau and his fellow applicants.  \"Lau\" thus became the first case in which the CFA had to take into account an NPCSC interpretation in applying the Basic Law. \n\nCraig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976) , was the first case in which a majority of the United States Supreme Court determined that statutory or administrative sex classifications were subject to intermediate scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. \n\nUnited States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 US 131 (1948) (also known as the Hollywood Antitrust Case of 1948, the Paramount Case, the Paramount Decision or the Paramount Decree) was a landmark United States Supreme Court antitrust case that decided the fate of movie studios owning their own theatres and holding exclusivity rights on which theatres would show their films.  It would also change the way Hollywood movies were produced, distributed, and exhibited.  The Court held in this case that the existing distribution scheme was in violation of the antitrust laws of the United States, which prohibit certain exclusive dealing arrangements. \n\nR v Van der Peet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507 is a leading case on Aboriginal rights under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.  The Supreme Court held that Aboriginal fishing rights did not extend to commercial selling of fish.  From this case came the Van der Peet test for determining if an Aboriginal right exists.  This is the first of three cases known as the Van der Peet trilogy which included \"R v NTC Smokehouse Ltd\" and \"R v Gladstone\". \n\nNorwood, Ohio v. Horney 110 Ohio St.3d 353 was a case brought before the Ohio Supreme Court in 2006.  The case came upon the heels of \"Kelo v. City of New London\", in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that commercial development justified the use of eminent domain.  \"Kelo\" had involved the United States Constitution, while the issue in \"Norwood\" was the specific limitations of the Ohio State Constitution. \n\nBlock booking is a system of selling multiple films to a theater as a unit.  Block booking was the prevailing practice among Hollywood's major studios from the turn of the 1930s until it was outlawed by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \"United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.\" (1948).  Under block booking, \"independent ('unaffiliated') theater owners were forced to take large numbers of [a] studio's pictures sight unseen.  Those studios could then parcel out second-rate product along with A-class features and star vehicles, which made both production and distribution operations more economical.\"  The element of the system involving the purchase of unseen pictures is known as blind bidding. \n\nDuring the tenure of Morrison Waite as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (March 4, 1874 through March 23, 1888), the Supreme Court heard an unprecedented volume and frequency of criminal cases.  In just fourteen years, the Court heard 106 criminal cases, almost as many cases as the Supreme Court had heard in the period from its creation to the appointment of Waite as Chief Justice.  Notable cases include \"United States v. Cruikshank\" (1875), \"United States v. Reese\" (1875), \"Reynolds v. United States\" (1878), \"Wilkerson v. Utah\" (1879), the \"Trade-Mark Cases\" (1879), \"Strauder v. West Virginia\" (1880), \"Pace v. Alabama\" (1883), \"United States v. Harris\" (1883), \"Ex parte Crow Dog\" (1883), \"Hurtado v. California\" (1884), \"Clawson v. United States\" (1885), \"Yick Wo v. Hopkins\" (1886), \"United States v. Kagama\" (1886), \"Ker v. Illinois\" (1886), and \"Mugler v. Kansas\" (1887). \n\n",

It is owned by the City of Concord and operated by Live Nation.  The Pavilion has a capacity of 12,500 people and opened in 1975 as the Concord Pavilion.  It is used for concerts, local community events (including an annual jazz festival) and local high school graduations. \n\nThe Kertha Gosa pavilion is an example of Balinese architecture located on the island of Bali, in the city Klungkung, Indonesia.  The Kertha Gosa Pavilion at Klungkung Palace was first built in the early 18th century by Dewa Agung Gusti Sideman.  The first function of the pavilion was for the court of law in 1945.  Kertha Gosa was repainted in the 1920s and again in the 1960s.  The people who discovered the pavilion knew there was an extensive history behind the pavilion.  The discovery of Kertha Gosa pavilion was only known by people writing about it here or there to others outside of Bali.  The Kertha Gosa Pavilion at Klungkung has the story of Bhima Swarga painted around the ceiling.  Bhima Swarga is a Hindu epic referenced from the Mahabharata.  The story at the Kertha Gosa Pavilion is not the whole Mahabharata but one small section called Bhima Swarga. \n\nThe Oleson Park Music Pavilion, also known as the Karl King Bandshell, is located in Fort Dodge, Iowa, United States.  The pavilion is associated with Karl King, a famed composer for concert and military bands, who advocated for its construction.  It was designed by Henry L. Kamphoefner, a Sioux City architect at that time, who had previously designed the Grandview Park Music Pavilion in Sioux City.  It was built as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project.  The WPA paid for 85% of its construction, with the City of Fort Dodge paying the rest.  The poured concrete structure was built in a Modernist style with Art Deco overtones.  It rises to a height of 36 ft , and it is known for its acoustical excellence.  The pavilion replaced a bandstand that was built in the 1920s in the city square.  It was dedicated to King in 1976, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. \n\nA sala (Thai: \u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e32 \u00a0] ; Khmer: \u179f\u17b6\u179b\u17b6 ] ), also known as a sala Thai, is an open pavilion, used as a meeting place and to protect people from sun and rain.  Most are open on all four sides.  They are found throughout Thailand in Buddhist temple areas, or wats, although they can also be located in other places.  A person who builds a sala at a temple or in a public place gains religious merit.  A sala located in a temple is called a \"salawat\" (\u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e32\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14).  Some temples have large salas where laity can hear sermons or receive religious instructions.  These are called \"sala kan parian\" (\u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e32\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e35\u0e22\u0e0d), meaning pavilion where monks learn for the Parian examination.  The city halls or offices of the province governors are called \"sala wa kan\" (\u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e32\u0e27\u0e48\u0e32\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23, literally meaning \"government pavilion\") or \"sala klang changwat\" (\u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e32\u0e01\u0e25\u0e32\u0e07\u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14, literally meaning a provincial main pavilion). \n\nThe Darling's Waterfront Pavilion (originally known as the Bangor Waterfront Pavilion) is an open-air amphitheater located within the Waterfront Park in Bangor, Maine.  The venue is a temporary structure built alongside the Penobscot River.  The venue typically operates from July until October. \n\nCorus Quay, originally named First Waterfront Place, is an eight-storey commercial office tower located on a 2.5 acre waterfront site in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The $160 million building is the first major development planned for the East Bayfront district, and completed construction at the foot of Jarvis Street.  Corus Quay is Corus Entertainment's new Toronto headquarters, consolidating its 10 locations and 1,200 employees into one site.  The building was being developed by the Toronto Economic Development Corporation (TEDCO), a city agency.  Funding for the project came from TEDCO's equity, city loans and a $12.5 million contribution from the city contributed via Waterfront Toronto. \n\nSilver Line Way is a surface bus rapid transit station on the MBTA Silver Line, located on Silver Line Way at Pumphouse Road between Massport Haul Road (Trilling Street) and D Street near the South Boston Waterfront.  The station is a block south of the Boston Fish Pier; it also serves the Boston Renaissance Waterfront Hotel and the Blue Hills Bank Pavilion. \n\nThe Zuiweng Pavilion (, is a pavilion lying to the south east of Chuzhou City, Anhui Province, People's Republic of China.  Located in The Northern Song Dynasty whilst the structure that exists today dates to the Qing Dynasty (1644\u20131911).  The pavilion takes its name from the Northern Song poet Ouyang Xiu, who called himself the \"Old Toper\" and wrote a poem entitled \"Zuiweng Tingji\" or \"An Account of the Old Toper's Pavilion\". \n\nThe Grandview Park Music Pavilion is a historic structure located in Sioux City, Iowa, United States.  The Monahan Post Band raised money in 1930 to build a modest music shell in the park.  Construction was already underway when the park's neighbors objected to the design.  The project was put on hold as the band raised more money and sought a more suitable design.  After President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Civil Works Administration (CWA) in 1933, the city applied to have the new music shell included in Sioux City's projects.  Henry L. Kamphoefner, an unknown Sioux City architect at that time, drew up the plans for the structure.  The sculptural plaques on the front of the pavilion were designed by Herschel Elarth.  The CWA approved the project on February 26, 1934 as CWA Project Number 217.  The construction project required 52 tons of reinforcing steel, 4,200 bags of Portland cement, and 300 bags of white cement, and it was completed on October 17, 1934.  Seating was constructed for 5,000 in the natural amphitheater.  The pavilion was built using $47,436 from Federal Relief funds and $3,800 in materials from the city.  It was dedicated in the spring of 1935.  The Monahan Post Band continued to play here until 1948, when they became the Sioux City Municipal Band.  They continue the summer-time tradition.  The music pavilion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. \n\nPaulus Hook is a community on the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City, New Jersey, located one mile across the river from Manhattan.  The name Hook comes from the Dutch word \"hoeck\" which translates into \"point of land.\"  This \"point of land\" has been described as an elevated area, the location of which is today bounded by Montgomery, Hudson, Dudley and Van Vorst Streets.  The neighborhood's main street is the north- and south-running Washington Street.  The waterfront of Paulus Hook is along the basin of the Morris Canal in a park with a segment of Liberty State Park.  The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail has a Paulus Hook stop at Essex Street and the Liberty Water Taxi at Warren Street.  The introduction of the light rail and development of office buildings on the Hudson Waterfront have brought more businesses to Morris Street including a number of restaurants with outdoor seating and small neighborhood shops. \n\n",

He also served in the American Revolutionary War; was a well-known surveyor; was one of the first associate judges in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania; and served in the United States Army in the War of 1812. \n\nThis list of fossils with consumulites contains fossil specimens discovered to contain the preserved remains of food that the deceased animal had ingested during life.  Such consumulites are a type of bromalite, the broader term applied to fossilized material ingested by an animal including waste expelled from the body like feces (coprolites) and vomit (regurgitalites).  Consumulites are divided into three categories food in the animal's mouth when it died (oralites), food in the animal's throat when it died (esophagolites), partially digested stomach contents (gastrolites, not to be confused with gastro\"liths\"), and food found in the animal's intestinal tract (cololites). \n\nHall Caine Airport was an airfield on the Isle of Man which was located near Ramsey.  It was named after the author Sir Thomas Henry Hall Caine CH, KBE by his sons Gordon Hall Caine and Derwent Hall Caine, who were the project initiators and Hall Caine Airport flourished for a short period prior to the outbreak of the Second World War.  From 1935 to 1937 it handled domestic scheduled passenger flights to English, Scottish and Irish airports.

The cuisine of Karachi is strongly influenced by the city's Urdu speaking Muslims, also known as Muhajir population, who came from northern India and settled in Karachi after the independence of Pakistan in 1947.  Most Urdu speaking Muslims have traditionally been based in Karachi, hence the city is known for Muhajir tastes in its cuisine.  Urdu speaking Muslims maintained their old established culinary traditions, including variety of dishes and beverages. \n\nHistoric Camden Revolutionary War Site, is a national historic district and open-air museum located in Camden, Kershaw County, South Carolina.  Roughly 40 minutes away from Columbia, South Carolina the state capitol it is one of the states largest tourist attractions.  The 107-acre site is also known as Historic Camden Revolutionary War Restoration and as the British Revolutionary War Fortifications.

Born into a Navy family, Plampin went to sea at age 13 and fought throughout the American Revolutionary War, based principally in the Caribbean Sea.  During the French Revolutionary Wars, Plampin served in a number of ships with mixed success, once being involved in a shipwreck and twice serving ashore during sieges.  After the Peace of Amiens, Plampin took command of the ship of the line HMS\u00a0\"Powerful\" and operated successfully in the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.  In 1816, following the defeat and capture of the French Emperor, Plampin was placed in command of the squadron at the Cape of Good Hope, which also had responsibility for Saint Helena, which Plampin regularly visited and had numerous conversations with Napoleon. \n\nBlanket bog or blanket mire, also known as featherbed bog, is an area of peatland, forming where there is a climate of high rainfall and a low level of evapotranspiration, allowing peat to develop not only in wet hollows but over large expanses of undulating ground.  The blanketing of the ground with a variable depth of peat gives the habitat type its name.  Blanket bogs are found extensively throughout the northern hemisphere - well-studied examples are found in Ireland and Britain, but vast areas of the Russian and North American tundra also qualify as blanket bogs. \n\nCarnival Cravings (also known as Carnival Cravings with Anthony Anderson) is an American television series on Food Network about unique food found at American carnivals.

        "context": "A&W Restaurants, Inc. is a chain of fast-food restaurants distinguished by its draft root beer and root beer floats.  Its origins date back to when Roy W. Allen opened a walk-up root beer stand in Lodi, California, in 1919.  Allen's employee Frank Wright partnered with him and founded the first A&W restaurant in Sacramento, California, in 1923.  The company name was taken respectively from the initials of their last names\u2014Allen and Wright.  The company became famous in the United States for its \"frosty mugs,\" where the mugs would be kept in the freezer and eventually get filled with A&W Root Beer before they are served to customers. \n\nJacob D. Robida (June 13, 1987 \u2013 February 5, 2006) was a Massachusetts teenager who attacked three patrons at a New Bedford gay bar on February 2, 2006.  He fled the state and drove to Charleston, West Virginia, where he kidnapped Jennifer Rena Dunlap Bailey and drove southwest.  He was stopped by Gassville, Arkansas Police Officer James W. Sell at the Brass Door Restaurant parking lot on the afternoon of February 4, 2006 for an apparent traffic violation.  Robida shot and killed Sell and fled east.  He turned onto Arkansas Highway 201 headed south and continued to Arkana, where he fired at Arkansas State Police Sgt. Van Nowlin.  Deputies from the Baxter County Sheriff's Office had a spike strip deployed a short distance away.  Robida drove over the spike strip, flattening both front tires on his Pontiac.  He continued to Arkansas Highway 5, where he turned south and drove into the small town of Norfork.  In the middle of town he lost control of the car due to the front tires, spun out, and hit two parked vehicles.  He then shot Bailey, his kidnap victim, in the head with a Ruger 9mm semi-automatic pistol, killing her instantly.  Police then opened fire on Robida.  He shot himself in the right side of the head. \n\nCoronado is a coastal city and resort located about an hour from Panama City.  It is a vacation town visited yearly by thousands of national and international tourists.  Coronado was Panama's first resort development, and for this reason has several years of advantage over other surrounding beach towns.  The town has full scale supermarkets, pharmacies, restaurants, ranging from low cost \"fondas\" and fast-food restaurants to beachside bistros, medical and veterinary clinics, a hospital, gardening centers, hardware stores, banks, apparel shops, outdoor markets, a shopping plaza and a new shopping mall. \n\nThe strip search phone call scam is a series of incidents that extended over a period of about ten years before an arrest was made in 2004.  The incidents involved a man prank calling a restaurant or grocery store, claiming to be a police officer and then convincing managers to conduct strip searches of female employees, and to perform other bizarre acts on behalf of \"the police\".  The calls were most often placed to fast-food restaurants in small towns, located in rural areas of the United States. \n\nDevyani Khobragade is an Indian Foreign Service officer.  While serving as Indian Deputy Consul General in New York, she made international headlines when she was arrested by US law enforcement for making false statements on a visa application for her housekeeper, paying her maid $3.99 an hour despite promising on the maid's visa application to pay the minimum legal wage.  Khobragade was arrested after dropping off her daughters at school in Manhattan.  She was subjected to a body-cavity search commonly called a \"strip search\", presented to a judge and released the same day.  This led to a major diplomatic standoff between India and the United States.  In 2016, she entered the world of fiction with her first book, \"The White Sari\". \n\nPolice perjury (or testilying in United States police slang) is the act of a police officer giving false testimony.  It is typically used in a criminal trial to \"make the case\" against a defendant who the police believe to be guilty when irregularities during the suspect's arrest or search threaten to result in acquittal.  It has broader meanings.  It also can be extended further to encompass substantive misstatements of fact for the purpose of convicting those whom the police believe to be guilty, or even to include statements to frame an innocent citizen.  More generically, it has been said to be: \"Lying under oath, especially by a police officer, to help get a conviction.\" \n\nRinger Hut (\u30ea\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc\u30cf\u30c3\u30c8 ) is a Japanese chain of fast-food restaurants, specializing in Nagasaki dishes Champon and Sara udon.  The Hamakatsu Co. of Nagasaki, founders of the chain in 1974, borrowed the name of the former Ringer House which had been purchased by Nagasaki City and opened as a tourist attraction in 1966.  It is likely that the company borrowed the word \"hut\" from \"Pizza Hut.\"  Ringer Hut operates over 550 restaurants in Japan, Taiwan, and San Jose, California along with 100 Hamakatsu Restaurants (tonkatsu restaurant chain).  Ringer Hut has two headquarters located in Fukuoka and Tokyo. \n\nA body cavity search, also known simply as a cavity search, is either a visual search or a manual internal inspection of body cavities for prohibited materials (contraband), such as illegal drugs, money, jewelry, or weapons.  Body cavities used for concealment include nostrils, ears, mouth, navel, penis (urethra and foreskin) or vagina, and rectum.  It is far more invasive than the standard strip search that is typically performed on individuals taken into custody, either upon police arrest or incarceration at a jail, prison, or psychiatric hospital.  Often the procedure is repeated when the person leaves the institution. \n\nCompliance is a 2012 American thriller film written and directed by Craig Zobel, and starring Ann Dowd, Dreama Walker, and Pat Healy.  The plot focuses on a prank caller who, posing as a police officer, convinces the manager of a fast food restaurant to carry out intrusive and unlawful procedures on an employee.  The film is based on the strip search prank call scam that took place at a Mount Washington, Kentucky McDonald's restaurant in Bullit County.  Dowd's performance as Sandra, the manager, won her the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress. \n\nPart-time job terrorism (\u30d0\u30a4\u30c8\u30c6\u30ed , baito tero ) is a Japanese social phenomenon; part-time employees perform pranks and stunts, such as climbing into ice cream freezers or holding their body horizontally suspended, more colloquially termed 'planking', on the counter-tops at fast-food restaurants, usually with the sole purpose of gaining recognition from their peers through the photos and/or videos they later display on social media sites.  This social phenomenon commonly involves people with high job dissatisfaction\u2014a factor which is commonly cited by the media alongside low pay and arduously long working hours.  Although pranks such as the aforementioned would not be seen as shocking by many other cultures, they are considered disgraceful in Japanese culture. \n\n",

        "context": "In baseball, batting average (AVG) is a measure of a batter's success rate in achieving a hit during an at bat.  In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB).  In MLB, a player in each league wins the \"batting title\" each season for having the highest batting average that year.  The American League (AL) winner is known as the \"Rod Carew American League Batting Champion\", while the National League (NL) leader is designated the \"Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion\".  Under current rules, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title.  However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average, he wins the title.  Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs.  Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to .349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title. \n\nJohn Paul \"Jack\" Fox (May 21, 1885 \u2013 June 28, 1963) was a professional baseball player whose career spanned 11 seasons, including one in Major League Baseball.  During that one season in 1908, Fox played with the Philadelphia Athletics.  Fox compiled a major league batting average of .200 with two runs, six hits and two stolen bases in nine games played.  Fox also played in the minor leagues with the Class-C Poughkeepsie Colts (1906), the Class-B Albany Senators (1906\u201307), the Class-A Jersey City Skeeters (1908), the Class-A Memphis Egyptians (1908), the Class-B Wilkes-Barre Barons (1909), the Class-B Troy Trojans, the Class-A Lincoln Railsplitters (1910\u201311), the Class-B Harrisburg Senators (1912\u201314), the Class-D Bradford Drillers (1914) and the Class-B Scranton Miners (1915\u201316).

As early proof of the baseball adage that \"Good Pitching Beats Good Hitting\", the downfall of the 1921 Tigers was the absence of good pitching.  The team ERA was 4.40, they allowed nine or more runs 28 times, and only one pitcher (Dutch Leonard) had an ERA below 4.24. \n\nCharles Henry \"Chick\" Shorten (April 19, 1892 \u2013 October 23, 1965) was an American baseball player.

        "context": "\"Evermore\" is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice for the musical fantasy film \"Beauty and the Beast\" (2017), a live-action remake of Disney's 1991 animated film of the same name.  Originally recorded for the film by English actor Dan Stevens, who performs the song in his starring role as the titular Beast, \"Evermore\" was first released as a single by American singer Josh Groban on March 3, 2017.  Stevens' version was made available on March 10, 2017 when the film's soundtrack was released online, while Groban's single is played in closing credits. \n\nRobin David Segal (born January 21, 1956), better known by the stage name Robby Benson, is an American actor, director, singer and educator.  He is known as the voice of The Beast in the Disney animated film \"Beauty and the Beast\" and its numerous sequels and spin-offs, and for directing several episodes of the popular sitcom \"Friends\". \n\n\"Belle\" is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman for Walt Disney Pictures' 30th animated feature film \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991).  Originally recorded by American actress and singer Paige O'Hara and American actor Richard White, \"Belle\", a mid-tempo French and classical music-inspired song, incorporates both Broadway and musical theatre elements.  The film's first song and opening number, \"Belle\" appears during \"Beauty and the Beast \"as a large scale operetta-style production number that introduces the film's heroine Belle, considered a book-loving nonconformist by the townspeople of the village, who has grown weary of the provincial life in which she is supposed to live, and Gaston, the film's narcissistic villain who wishes to desire her hand in marriage despite Belle's rejections. \n\n\"Be Our Guest\" is a song written by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken for Walt Disney Pictures' 30th animated feature film \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991).  Recorded by American actor Jerry Orbach and English actress Angela Lansbury as Lumiere and Mrs. Potts, respectively, \"Be Our Guest\" is a large-scale Broadway-inspired musical number that takes place during the first half of \"Beauty and the Beast\", performed by the castle's staff of enchanted objects in an elaborate attempt to welcome Belle.  Menken initially intended for the melody of \"Be Our Guest\" to be temporary but was ultimately unable to compose a satisfying one with which to replace it.  The song had originally been intended for Belle's father Maurice.  However, \"Be Our Guest\" had to be entirely re-written as the story evolved in order to return its focus to Belle. \n\nAnna Simpson (born March 23, 1985) is an American actress and singer born in Brooklyn, New York.  She is best known for the film, \"Our Song\", alongside Kerry Washington and Melissa Martinez (2000).  She has a daughter named Chasity who she gave birth to at the age of 15.  Simpson is a survivor of sexual abuse. \n\nDonna Paige Helmintoller, better known as Paige O'Hara (born May 10, 1956), is an American actress, singer and painter.  O'Hara began her career as a Broadway actress in 1983 when she portrayed Ellie May Chipley in the musical \"Showboat\".  In 1991, she made her motion picture debut in Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\", in which she voiced the film's heroine, Belle.  Following the critical and commercial success of \"Beauty and the Beast\", O'Hara reprised her role as Belle in the film's two direct-to-video follow-ups, \"\" and \"Belle's Magical World\". \n\n\"Beauty and the Beast\" is a song written by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken for the Disney animated feature film \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991).  The film's theme song, the Broadway-inspired ballad was first recorded by British-American actress Angela Lansbury in her role as the voice of the character Mrs. Potts, and essentially describes the relationship between its two main characters Belle and the Beast, specifically how the couple has learned to accept their differences and in turn change each other for the better.  Additionally, the song's lyrics imply that the feeling of love is as timeless and ageless as a \"tale as old as time\".  Lansbury's rendition is heard during the famous ballroom sequence between Belle and the Beast, while a shorted chorale version plays in the closing scenes of the film, and the song's motif features frequently in other pieces of Menken's film score.  \"Beauty and the Beast\" was subsequently recorded as a pop duet by Canadian singer Celine Dion and American singer Peabo Bryson, and released as the only single from the film's soundtrack on November 25, 1991. \n\nMarissa Perry (born May 5, 1985) is an American actress and singer born in Waterbury, Connecticut. \n\n\"Something There\" is a song written by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken for Walt Disney Pictures 30th animated feature film \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991).  Sung by the majority of the film's main cast, the song was recorded by American actors Paige O'Hara as Belle and Robby Benson as the Beast via voice over, featuring actors Jerry Orbach, Angela Lansbury and David Ogden Stiers as Lumiere, Mrs. Potts and Cogsworth, respectively.  The only song performed by the Beast, \"Something There\" is heard midway through \"Beauty and the Beast \"during a scene in which Belle and the Beast finally begin to acknowledge their own feelings for each other. \n\nBelle is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Pictures' 30th animated feature film \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991).  Originally voiced by American actress and singer Paige O'Hara, Belle is the non-conforming daughter of an inventor.  Belle yearns to abandon her predictable village life in return for adventure.  When her father Maurice is imprisoned by a cold-hearted beast, Belle offers him her own freedom in exchange for her father's, and eventually learns to love the Beast despite his unsightly outward appearance. \n\n",

        "context": "Accompaniment is the musical parts which provide the rhythmic and/or harmonic support for the melody or main themes of a song or instrumental piece.  There are many different styles and types of accompaniment in different genres and styles of music.  In homophonic music, the main accompaniment approach used in popular music, a clear vocal melody is supported by subordinate chords.  In popular music and traditional music, the accompaniment parts typically provide the \"beat\" for the music and outline the chord progression of the song or instrumental piece.  The accompaniment for a vocal melody or instrumental solo can be played by a single musician playing an instrument such as piano, pipe organ, or guitar.  While any instrument can in theory be used as an accompaniment instrument, keyboard and guitar-family instruments tend to be used if there is only a single instrument, as these instruments can play chords and basslines simultaneously (chords and a bassline are easier to play simultaneously on keyboard instruments, but a fingerpicking guitarist can play chords and a bassline simultaneously on guitar).  A solo singer can accompany herself by playing guitar or piano while she sings, and in some rare cases, a solo singer can even accompany himself or herself just using his or her voice and body (e.g., Bobby McFerrin). \n\nA bukkehorn (Norwegian) or bockhorn (Swedish), also called \u2033Billy Goat Horn\u2033 in English, is an ancient Scandinavian musical instrument, made from the horn of a ram or a goat.  The horn is usually made from a goat horn harvested 5 to 7 years before the instrument is crafted.  It was traditionally used by shepherds and milkmaids on summer dairy farms in the mountains, as a signal-instrument or as a scaring instrument.  When the horn later got finger holes it became possible to play melodies with it.  The instrument has two blowing-techniques: the trumpet-principle is the most common, but the clarinet-principle is also used. \n\nChander Bari is a 2007 Bengali film directed by Tarun Majumdar.  The film centers on a middle class joint family.  The film is based on a Bengali story written by Pracheta Gupta.  Majumdar used some Rabindra Sangeets in this film. \n\nThe koto (Japanese: \u7b8f) is a traditional Japanese stringed musical instrument derived from the Chinese zheng, and similar to the Mongolian yatga, the Korean gayageum, and the Vietnamese \u0111\u00e0n tranh.  The koto is the national instrument of Japan.  Koto are about 180 cm length, and made from \"kiri\" wood (\"Paulownia tomentosa\").  They have 13 strings that are usually strung over 13 movable bridges along the width of the instrument.  There is also a 17-string koto variant.  Players can adjust the string pitches by moving the white bridges before playing.  To play the instrument, the strings are plucked using three finger picks, otherwise known as plectra, (on thumb, index finger, and middle finger). \n\nThe sousaphone ( ), is a brass instrument in the same family as the more widely known tuba.  Created around 1893 by J.W. Pepper at the direction of American bandleader John Philip Sousa (whom the instrument was then named after), it was designed to be easier to play than the concert tuba while standing or marching, as well as to carry the sound of the instrument above the heads of the band.  Like the tuba, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or \"buzz\" into a large cupped mouthpiece.  Unlike the tuba, the instrument is bent in a circle to fit around the body of the musician; it ends in a large, flaring bell that is pointed forward, projecting the sound ahead of the player.  Because of the ease of carrying and the direction of sound, it is widely employed in marching bands, as well as various other musical genres.  Sousaphones were originally made out of brass but in the mid-20th century started to be made from lighter materials like fiberglass; today both types are in wide use. \n\nEmbouchure or lipping is the use of the lips, facial muscles, tongue, and teeth in playing a wind instrument.  This includes shaping the lips to the mouthpiece of a woodwind instrument or the mouthpiece of a brass instrument.  The word is of French origin and is related to the root \"bouche \", 'mouth'.  Proper embouchure allows instrumentalists to play their instrument at its full range with a full, clear tone and without strain or damage to their muscles. \n\nUdaka Vadya is an Indian musical instrument.  It is assumed either this musical instruments had been Jal tarang or similar to it.  This percussion instrument has been categorized in medieval musical treatise under Ghan Vadya (diophonic instruments where the sound is produced by striking a surface).  This instrument has been mentioned in Vatsyayana's Kamasutra, also Sangeeta Parijata of the 17th century mentioned about this instrument.  The skill to play this instrument was one of the essential 64 kala to be learnt by a woman. \n\nAn experimental musical instrument (or custom-made instrument) is a musical instrument that modifies or extends an existing instrument or class of instruments, or defines or creates a new class of instrument.  Some are created through simple modifications, such as cracked drum cymbals or metal objects inserted between piano strings in a prepared piano.  Some experimental instruments are created from household items like a homemade mute for brass instruments such as bathtub plugs.  Other experimental instruments are created from electronic spare parts, or by mixing acoustic instruments with electric components. \n\nAn asset class is a group of instruments which have similar financial characteristics and behave similarly in the marketplace.  We can often break these instruments into those having to do with real assets and those having to do with financial assets.  Often, assets within the same asset class are subject to the same laws and regulations; however, this is not always true.  For instance, futures on an asset are often considered part of the same asset class as the underlying instrument but are subject to different regulations than the underlying instrument. \n\nThe keyboard glockenspiel (French: \"jeu de timbre\") or organ glockenspiel is an instrument consisting of a glockenspiel operated by a piano keyboard.  It was first used by George Frideric Handel in the oratorio \"Saul\" (1739).  It was also used in the 1739 revivals of his \"Il Trionfo del Tempo\" and \"Acis and Galatea\", and the next year in \"L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato\".  Half a century later, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart employed a \"strumento d\u2019acciaio\" in \"The Magic Flute\" (1791) to represent Papageno's magic bells, and this instrument is believed to have been a keyboard glockenspiel.  This part is nowadays sometimes taken by a celesta.  Maurice Ravel preferred the keyboard version of the instrument because it can play a true ff dynamic for brilliance and iridescence in orchestral climaxes.  In the late 20th century, the firm of Bergerault began manufacturing a three-octave (F2\u2013E4) mallet instrument with a damping mechanism operated by a foot pedal, which is capable of dealing with the wide range called for in contemporary scores. \n\n",

        "context": "Surfer hair is a tousled type of hairstyle, popularized by surfers from the 1950s onwards, traditionally long, thick and naturally bleached from high exposure to the sun and salt water of the sea.  In the late 1960s and 1970s, the long hair and general lack of personal grooming was closely associated with hippie culture.  Today, hairstyling companies brand their own hair gels, shampoos and hair wax to achieve the \"surfer look\", with hairstyles, often shorter than traditionally, which often require more grooming to achieve the permanent hair lift or intentional windswept look.  Amongst women, fashion magazines have referred to \"sun streaked surfer hair\" as a desirable look for women, although genuine surfer hair is often heavily damaged by the elements. \n\nChrysalis: A Magazine of Women's Culture was a feminist publication produced from 1977 to 1980.  The self-published magazine was founded by Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie at the Woman's Building in downtown Los Angeles.  \"Chysalis\" grew from Grimstad and Rennie's editorial work on the self-help resource books, The New Woman's Survival Catalog and The New Woman's Survival Sourcebook.  \"Chrysalis\" distinguished itself from other feminist publications through an organic integration of politics, literature, cultural studies, and art.  The magazine was produced through a collective process that grew out of the feminist practice of consciousness-raising.  Unusually broad in scope, \"Chrysalis\" did not substitute breadth for quality.  The authors, poets, essayists, and researchers contributing to the magazine reveals a veritable who's who of towering intellects of the feminist movement: black lesbian activist Audre Lorde; the magazine's poetry editor, Robin Morgan, who later served as editor of Ms. from 1990-1993: award winning poet Adrienne Rich; novelist Marge Percy; artist Judy Chicago; science fiction writer Joanna Russ; art critic Lucy Lippard, plus Mary Daly, Dolores Hayden, Andrea Dworkin, Marilyn Hacker, Arlene Raven, and Elizabeth Janeway.  Over a three-year span, the all volunteer staff produced ten issues before they were forced to disband in 1981 due to financial difficulties. \n\nThe magazine sector in Austria is under the dominance of Germany.  This influence decreased at the end of the 1990s, but it continued on the women's magazines and fashion magazines.  However, business magazines have not been subject to the dominance of Germany.  The major fields of Austrian magazines are news, popular science and special interest topics.  On the other hand, since the Austrian press market is divided between magazines and newspapers, magazines have a significant function in the press market. \n\nThe following is an incomplete list of current and defunct magazines published in Egypt.  They may be published in Arabic or in other languages.  The history of Egyptian magazines is long, dating back to the 1890s.  The earliest magazines also included women's magazines as well as those published in Turkish from 1828 to 1947.  The first children's magazine was published in 1893. \n\nRick Wilber is an American author, poet, and editor.  He has published more than thirty-five short stories in magazines such as \"Aboriginal SF\", \"Analog\", \"Asimov's Science Fiction\", \"Fantasy & Science Fiction\", \"Pulphouse\", and \"SF Age\"; and in anthologies such as \"Alien Sex\" and \"Chrysalis\".  In addition to his short stories, he has written the novels \"Rum Point\", \"The Cold Road\", and \"Alien Morning\", as well as a memoir, \"My Father's Game: Life, Death, Baseball\", and several textbooks, including \"Modern Media Writing\" and \"Magazine Feature Writing\". \n\nThe first women's magazine was published in Malaysia in 1932.  In the 2000s there were nearly fifty local titles addressing women in the country.  These magazines also include those having an Islamic perspective.  Some international women's magazines are also published in Malaysia.  One of them is \"Elle Malaysia\", which was first published in March 2014.  Another one, \"Women\u2019s Health\", was started in April 2015.  Comic magazines and film magazines are also common in Malaysia. \n\nLifestyle magazine is an umbrella term for popular magazines concerned with lifestyle and is often used to encompass a number of men's magazines, women's magazines and magazines about health and fitness, tourism, leisure, fashion, decorating, or culture.  The concept is chiefly used in reference to a magazine's tone. \n\nThe Transition House Association of Nova Scotia (abbreviated THANS and TRANS) is a Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada-based organisation that runs women's shelters. Pamela Harrison is THANS's executive director, and also serves as provincial co-ordinator.  Rhonda Fraser, the executive director of Chrysalis House, is a member of THANS.  THANS organises an annual purple ribbon awareness campaign in memory of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique massacre.  THANS was founded in 1989.  THANS conducted interviews with 34 physically abused women who subsequently sought resolution through family law mediation.  In 2000, THANS released a report based on these interviews, stating that most of the women would not recommend legal mediation to other abused women.  In 2008, THANS supported Bill 81, which they hoped would become the Domestic Violence Elimination Act, but Minister of Justice Cecil Clarke chose not to call the bill for a third reading.  In 2009, Darrell Dexter of the New Democratic Party identified THANS in his promise to increase government funding of halfway houses in Nova Scotia.  In 2012, THANS partnered with the World YWCA, Family SOS, Silent Witness Nova Scotia, and Leave Out Violence to host the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada's \"Ghosts of Violence\", a ballet about domestic violence, in Halifax. \n\nMagazines in Portugal are mostly women's magazines, society magazines and TV magazines.  In 1994 there were nearly 984 magazines in the country. \n\nA customer magazine is a magazine produced by a business as a means of communicating to its customers.  It is a branch of custom media, a product that broadly shares the look and feel of a newsstand or consumer magazine but is paid for in part or whole by a business.  Rather than copy sales and advertising, the primary goal of a customer magazine is to achieve a particular business objective.  This could be for a firm to cross- or up-sell, change brand perception or engender loyalty.  In-flight magazines, sponsored by airlines, were among the first customer magazines, and remain typical of the genre.  In the UK, every supermarket chain now provides a customer magazine to promote its products through recipes and other food editorial.  Many prominent digitally-native companies, like WebMD and Net-\u00c0-Port\u00e9r, have released customer magazines of their own.  Some customer magazines carry advertising; this is often seen as a useful way to offset the cost but equally can have some benefit in making the product look more like a regular magazine. \n\n",

        "context": "Eug\u00e8ne (Eugeniusz) Minkowski (] ; 17 April 1885 \u2013 17 November 1972) was a French psychiatrist of Jewish Polish origin, known for his incorporation of phenomenology into psychopathology and for exploring the notion of \"lived time\".  A student of Eugen Bleuler, he was also associated with the work of Ludwig Binswanger and Henri Ey.  He was influenced by the philosophy of Henri Bergson and by the phenomenologists Edmund Husserl and Max Scheler.  He was a prolific author in several languages and regarded as a great humanitarian. \n\nTime and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness (French: \"Essai sur les donn\u00e9es imm\u00e9diates de la conscience\") is Henri Bergson's doctoral thesis, first published in 1889.  The essay deals with the problem of free will, which Bergson contends is merely a common confusion among philosophers caused by an illegitimate translation of the unextended into the extended, as a means of introducing his theory of duration, which would become highly influential among continental philosophers in the following century. \n\nMoina Mathers, born Mina Bergson (28 February 1865 \u2013 25 July 1928), was an artist and occultist at the turn of the 20th century.  She was the sister of French philosopher Henri Bergson, the first man of Jewish descent to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927.  She is, however, more known for her marriage to the English occultist, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, one of the founders of the organisation Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and, after his death in 1918, for being the head of a successor organisation, called the Rosicrucian Order of the Alpha et Omega. \n\nThe 2011 Pulitzer Prizes were announced on Monday, April 18, 2011. \" The Los Angeles Times\" won two prizes, including the highest honor for Public Service. \" The New York Times\" also won two awards.  No prize was handed out in the Breaking News category. \" The Wall Street Journal\" won an award for the first time since 2007.  Jennifer Egan's \"A Visit From the Goon Squad\" picked up the Fiction prize after already winning the 2010 National Book Critics Circle Award.  Photographer Carol Guzy of \"The Washington Post\" became the first journalist to win four Pulitzer Prizes. \n\nThe Livingston Awards at the University of Michigan are American journalism awards issued to media professionals under the age of 35 for local, national, and international reporting.  They are the largest, all-media, general reporting prizes in America.  Popularly referred to as the \"Pulitzer for the Young\", the awards have recognized the early talent of journalists, including Michele Norris, Christiane Amanpour, David Remnick, Ira Glass, J. R. Moehringer, Thomas Friedman, Rick Atkinson, David Isay, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, Tom Ashbrook, Nicholas Confessore, C. J. Chivers and Charles Sennot. \n\n\"Introduction to Metaphysics\" (French: \"\"Introduction \u00e0 la M\u00e9taphysique\"\") is a 1903 essay about the concept of reality by Henri Bergson.  For Bergson, reality occurs not in a series of discrete states but as a process similar to that described by process philosophy or the Greek philosopher Heraclitus.  Reality is fluid and cannot be completely understood through reductionistic analysis, which he said \"implies that we go around an object\", gaining knowledge from various perspectives which are relative.  Instead, reality can be grasped absolutely only through intuition, which Bergson expressed as \"entering into\" the object. \n\nDuration (French: \"la dur\u00e9e\") is a theory of time and consciousness posited by the French philosopher Henri Bergson.  Bergson sought to improve upon inadequacies he perceived in the philosophy of Herbert Spencer, due, he believed, to Spencer's lack of comprehension of mechanics, which led Bergson to the conclusion that time eluded mathematics and science.  Bergson became aware that the moment one attempted to measure a moment, it would be gone: one measures an immobile, complete line, whereas time is mobile and incomplete.  For the individual, time may speed up or slow down, whereas, for science, it would remain the same.  Hence Bergson decided to explore the inner life of man, which is a kind of duration, neither a unity nor a quantitative multiplicity.  Duration is ineffable and can only be shown indirectly through images that can never reveal a complete picture.  It can only be grasped through a simple intuition of the imagination. \n\nSamuel Eliot Morison, (July 9, 1887 \u2013 May 15, 1976) was an American historian noted for his works of maritime history and American history that were both authoritative and popular.  He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1912, and taught history at the university for 40 years.  He won Pulitzer Prizes for \"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\" (1942), a biography of Christopher Columbus, and \"John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography\" (1959).  In 1942, he was commissioned to write a history of United States naval operations in World War II, which was published in 15 volumes between 1947 and 1962.  Morison wrote the popular \"Oxford History of the American People\" (1965), and co-authored the classic textbook \"The Growth of the American Republic\" (1930) with Henry Steele Commager.  Over the course of his distinguished career, Morison received eleven honorary doctoral degrees, and garnered numerous literary prizes, military honors, and national awards from both foreign countries and the United States, including two Pulitzer Prizes, two Bancroft Prizes, the Balzan Prize, the Legion of Merit, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \n\nMatter and Memory (French: \"Mati\u00e8re et m\u00e9moire\", 1896) is a book by the French philosopher Henri Bergson.  Its subtitle is \"Essay on the relation of body and spirit\" (\"Essai sur la relation du corps \u00e0 l\u2019esprit\"), and the work presents an analysis of the classical philosophical problems concerning this relation.  Within that frame the analysis of memory serves the purpose of clarifying the problem.  \"Matter and Memory\" was written in reaction to the book \"The Maladies of Memory\" by Th\u00e9odule Ribot, which appeared in 1881.  Ribot claimed that the findings of brain science proved that memory is lodged within a particular part of the nervous system; localized within the brain and thus being of a material nature.  Bergson was opposed to this reduction of spirit to matter.  Defending a clear anti-reductionist position, he considered memory to be of a deeply spiritual nature, the brain serving the need of orienting present action by inserting relevant memories.  The brain thus being of a practical nature, certain lesions tend to perturb this practical function, but without erasing memory as such.  The memories are, instead, simply not 'incarnated', and cannot serve their purpose. \n\n\u00c9lan vital (] ) is a term coined by French philosopher Henri Bergson in his 1907 book \"Creative Evolution\", in which he addresses the question of self-organisation and spontaneous morphogenesis of things in an increasingly complex manner.  \"Elan vital\" was translated in the English edition as \"vital impetus\", but is usually translated by his detractors as \"vital force\".  It is a hypothetical explanation for evolution and development of organisms, which Bergson linked closely with consciousness \u2013 with the intuitive perception of experience and the flow of inner time. \n\n",

Grant is widely known now as Lana Del Rey.  Kill Kill was first released on October 21, 2008, on Grant's three-track extended play of the same name.  It was then later included on her first album under the name Lana Del Ray, \"\"Lana Del Ray A.K.A. Lizzy Grant\"\" also alternatively titled simply \"\"Lana Del Rey\"\". \n\nLana Del Ray (alternatively written as Lana Del Ray a.k.a. Lizzy Grant) is the debut studio album by American singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey.  The album was released digitally via the iTunes Store by 5 Points Records on January 4, 2010 when she was known as Lana Del \"Ray\".  However, the record was eventually pulled from retailers soon afterwards because, according to Del Rey, the label was unable to fund it.  Del Rey ultimately bought back the rights to the album, whose title uses an alternate spelling of the singer's stage name, \"Del Rey\" being spelled \"Del Ray\" instead.  After releasing \"Born to Die\" (2012) under her stage name Lana Del Rey, she expressed her wish to re-release the album. \n\n\"Yayo\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey.  It appears on her first extended play, \"Kill Kill\", her debut album, \"Lana Del Ray\", and her third EP, \"Paradise\".  After the release of her third EP, the song charted in France.  Before signing to a major record label, Del Rey released a self-produced music video for \"Yayo\".  Ubiquitously, the song garnered acclaim, many reviewers saying the song was one of the best songs Del Rey has ever written and praising Del Rey's voice.  Appearing on three of Del Rey's albums to date, the song is one of few that was authored solely by her.  The original version of the song was released through 5 Point Records and produced by David Kahne, later being remastered by Emile Haynie and Dan Heath. \n\nYoann Lemoine (born 16 March 1983) is a French music video director, graphic designer and singer-songwriter.  His most notable works include his music video direction for Katy Perry's \"Teenage Dream\", Taylor Swift's single \"Back to December\", Lana Del Rey's \"Born to Die\" and Mystery Jets' \"Dreaming of Another World\". \n\n\"High by the Beach\" is a song recorded by American singer Lana Del Rey and the first single from her fourth studio album, \"Honeymoon\" (2015).  Written by Lana Del Rey, Rick Nowels and Kieron Menzies.  A synth-led trap-pop ballad, it is more uptempo and pop-indebted than Del Rey's previous releases, but prominently recalls the hip hop and trip hop influences of her 2012 album, \"Born to Die\".  The song is based around electronic production, a trap beat and an orchestral organ arrangement. \n\nAmerican singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey has released five studio albums, four extended plays, 20 singles, and 16 music videos. Lana Del Rey signed a record deal with 5 Points Records in 2007 and the following year, she released her debut EP, \"Kill Kill\", under the stage name Lizzy Grant.  Her debut studio album, \"Lana Del Ray\", was shelved initially and was released in January 2010 under the name Lana Del Ray.  However, the record was pulled three months later. \n\nAmerican singer and occasional actress Lana Del Rey has appeared in three films as an actress, eighteen television shows, and three commercials, along with offering her talents to five films as singer.  Del Rey's first appearance was in the independent film \"Poolside\" (2010), which features Del Rey playing Lisa, a rich girl who spends her days smoking cigarettes by the pool.  She received top billing for the project.  Del Rey's next appearance was in a less-than-one-minute long short art film titled \"Lana Del Rey\" which was produced by Interview magazine and features noir-ish style and cinematic themes.  Del Rey's breakout appearance was in an Anthony Mandler directed film, which Del Rey wrote, titled \"Tropico\" (2013).  The film features Del Rey as a fictionalized version of Eve while also playing the Virgin Mary.  \"Tropico\" received positive reviews and was Del Rey's second film that gave her top billing.  Along with appearing in a handful of short films, Del Rey has appeared in 18 television shows and specials as herself along with appearing in campaign commercials for companies including Keds and H&M. \n\n\"Video Games\" is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey for her second studio album and major label debut, \"Born to Die\" (2012).  It was first released to the Internet on June 29, 2011, was later released on her extended play, \"Lana Del Rey\", and re-released as the lead single from her second studio album, \"Born to Die\" on October 10, 2011, through Interscope Records.  The song was produced by Robopop while the lyrics were written by Del Rey and Justin Parker.  \"Video Games\" is a baroque pop ballad that speaks of the protagonist who, despite being ignored by her significant other, resolves to love him regardless. \n\nLana Del Rey is the second EP by American singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey.  It was released on January 10, 2012 in the United States and Canada through Interscope Records.  After publishing two unsuccessful works, an EP, \"Kill Kill\" (2008) and a studio album, \"Lana Del Ray\" (2010), the four-track EP was released in anticipation of Del Rey's major label debut \"Born to Die\" (2012).  The tracks are influenced by several genres, including indie pop, hip hop, and alternative music.  The lyrics and melody were written primarily by Del Rey, Patrik Berger, and Justin Parker.  Production of the album was led by Emile Haynie, who also co-wrote \"Blue Jeans\". \n\n\"Blue Jeans\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey for her second studio album \"Born to Die\" (2012).  It was released on April 8, 2012, by Interscope Records as the third single from the record.  Produced by Emile Haynie, the song was written by Del Rey, Haynie, and Dan Heath.  It is a downtempo ballad with hip hop influences.  A controversial performance of the song on \"SNL\" placed Del Rey under scrutiny and polarized opinion.  Charting across Europe and Asia, \"Blue Jeans\" reached the top 10 in Belgium, Poland, and Israel.  Two music videos were created for the song.  The first was self-produced.  The second was shot and directed by Yoann Lemoine, featuring film noir elements and crocodiles. \n\n",

        "context": "The Grand Ole Opry is a weekly country-music stage concert in Nashville, Tennessee, which was founded on November 28, 1925, by George D. Hay as a one-hour radio \"barn dance\" on WSM.  Currently owned and operated by Opry Entertainment (a division of Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.), it is the longest-running radio broadcast in US history, albeit not the longest-running one on a radio network.  Dedicated to honoring country music and its history, the Opry showcases a mix of famous singers and contemporary chart-toppers performing country, bluegrass, Americana, folk, gospel, and comedic performances and skits.  It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and Internet listeners. \n\nJohn England & the Western Swingers is a six piece Nashville, Tennessee band that plays Western swing.  The group has played at Nashville's Robert's Western World every Monday since July 2001.  The Swingers have also performed at New York's Lincoln Center, the Grand Ole Opry, the Legends of Western Swing Festival, the Ernest Tubb Record Shop's \"Midnight Jamboree\", and has been profiled by Downbeat magazine, the Nashville Tennessean, and other print media. \n\nBradley Gaskin (born in Gadsden, Alabama) is an American country music singer-songwriter.  He signed with Columbia Nashville in 2011 and has released his debut single, \"Mr. Bartender\" after being discovered through a talent contest sponsored by John Rich.  At the time, Gaskin had been working for his father hanging sheetrock.  The song entered the Hot Country Songs charts at number 51 on the chart dated for the week ending April 2, 2011.  He made his Grand Ole Opry debut on August 20th, 2011.  After a corporate restructuring, Gaskin moved to Columbia Records to release his second single, \"Diamonds Make Babies\".  On June 4, 2012, it was announced that Sony Nashville was retiring the BNA label and moving its roster to Columbia Nashville.  Gaskin was dropped from the label following this move.  Gaskin spent much of 2012 touring with Big & Rich, typically performing \"Mr. Bartender\" as well as a cover of Keith Whitley's \"Don't Close Your Eyes\".  Gaskin had plans for releasing a version of the Keith Whitley song prior to the problems that arose with his label.  Gaskin wrote a Tate Stevens \"Power of a Love Song\" in 2013.  Bradley performed \"Don't Close Your Eyes\" during a Grand Ole Opry performance on October 30, 2015. \n\nInfinity Cat Recordings is an independent record label founded in 2002 and based in Nashville, Tennessee.  The label has released recordings from artists including JEFF the Brotherhood, Diarrhea Planet, Be Your Own Pet, Ed Schrader's Music Beat, and Daddy Issues.  In 2011, the label was highlighted by British publication The Guardian, which wrote \"forget the Grand Ole Opry; there are more thrilling new bands in East Nashville than anywhere else on earth [and] so many of their records have been released on the same label, Infinity Cat.\" \n\nThe Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee.  The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee.  The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort.  Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as \"LD\" which is part of the Cincinnati Division.  From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee.  At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash \"Amqui\" location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as \"SA\" and operates on AAR58.  There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui.  From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track).  There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1.  Few more miles southward, the next major location appears.  At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal.  From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago.  The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track.  From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track.  From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike.  The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of \"0BA\" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal.  At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard.  Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals.  This location is known as North Radnor.  The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta.  The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures.  The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main.  Both lines remain double track for a while.  The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0.  Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south.  From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge.  At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40.  From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10.  After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown.  On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present.  This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it.  The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye.  The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic.  The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0.  The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 \"11th Avenue\" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track.  The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at \"Shops\".  Now speed has been increased.  The line is still double track until \"Sellars\", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher.  For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements.  The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3.  The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines.  The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed.  The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel.  Crew change usually occurs at the \"walkway\" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower.  This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins.  Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated.  At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now.  There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3.  About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double.  About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names).  When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \"Long Lead\".  And now, the Terminal splits into two parts.  The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood.  The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while.  This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line.  The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2.  Speed is now increased to 40.  Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance.  Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line.  At 00J3.6 known as A-1.  Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9).  Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line.  At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \"SC\".  At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill.  There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.  And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad.  Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard.  Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10.  Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192.  The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use.  The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs.  At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1.  Speed is now at 40.  2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present.  This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main.  There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track.  Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains.  This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent.  From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip.  The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood.  Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher.  The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR.  The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important. \n\nThe Bailey Brothers and the Happy Valley Boys were an American bluegrass act widely considered to be among the first to cultivate the duo harmony vocal technique widely used in modern bluegrass music today.  Charlie Bailey (February 11, 1916 in Happy Valley, Tennessee, near Rogersville \u2013 March 12, 2004 in Bear, Delaware) began his musical career in 1936.  His brother, Danny Bailey (December 1, 1919, Happy Valley, Tennessee \u2013 March 22, 2004, Knoxville, Tennessee), teamed up with him in 1940, and the brothers began making frequent appearances on Tennessee radio stations in the Knoxville area.  Danny formed the Happy Valley Boys after Charlie joined the military in 1941.  In 1944 the Happy Valley Boys relocated to Nashville, where they became members of the Grand Ole Opry, and also made regular appearances on WSM radio in Nashville.  At that time, Danny was the youngest person to ever perform on the Grand Ole Opry.  When Charlie returned from his military service in 1946 the brothers were reunited as a duo but only stayed in Nashville briefly before returning to radio work in Knoxville. \n\nMusic City Queen was a replica showboat formerly operating for entertainment purposes on the Cumberland River in the southern United States.  It was the smaller of two stern-wheel paddle steamers based at Opry Mills in Nashville, Tennessee; the other is the \"General Jackson\". \n\nRyman Auditorium (formerly Grand Ole Opry House and Union Gospel Tabernacle) is a 2,362-seat live performance venue, located at 116 5th Avenue North, in Nashville, Tennessee and is best known as the home of the \"Grand Ole Opry\" from 1943 to 1974.  It is owned and operated by Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. \n\nOpry Mills is a super-regional shopping mall owned by Simon Property Group, formerly by its initial owners Mills Corporation and Gaylord Entertainment.  It opened in Nashville, Tennessee in 2000 on the former site of the Opryland USA theme park. \n\nKeith Bilbrey (born August 14, 1952) is an American country music disc jockey and television host in Nashville, Tennessee.  He served as a disc jockey at Nashville's WSM, as an announcer on the Grand Ole Opry, and as the host of TNN\u2019s Grand Ole Opry Live. \n\n",

        "context": "On the night of May 10, 2011 an ethnic Mongol herdsman was killed by a coal truck driver near Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia, China.  The incident, alongside grievances over mining development in the region and the perceived erosion of traditional lifestyle of indigenous peoples, led to a series of Mongol protests across Inner Mongolia.  Some 2000 students participated in protests at Communist Party headquarters of the West Ujimqin Banner, followed by demonstrations by secondary school students in the Xilinhot area.  Select secondary schools and universities with large ethnic Mongol populations were reportedly under \"lockdown\".

Apart from Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, the line also crosses the Subei Mongol Autonomous County, the sliver of Gansu Province that extends to the Mongolian border.  Construction began on June 30, 2014 and was slated to take three years, but the line opened only 17 months later on December 1, 2015.

        "context": "Chris Marker (] ; 29 July 1921 \u2013 29 July 2012) was a French writer, photographer, documentary film director, multimedia artist and film essayist.  His best known films are \"La Jet\u00e9e\" (1962), \"Le Joli Mai\" (1963), \"A Grin Without a Cat\" (1977) and \"Sans Soleil\" (1983).  Marker is often associated with the Left Bank Cinema movement that occurred in the late 1950s and included such other filmmakers as Alain Resnais, Agn\u00e8s Varda, Henri Colpi and Armand Gatti. \n\nL'Ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re \u00e0 Marienbad (released in the US as Last Year at Marienbad and in the UK as Last Year in Marienbad) is a 1961 French-Italian film directed by Alain Resnais from a screenplay by Alain Robbe-Grillet. \n\nAlain Resnais (] ; 3 June 19221 March 2014) was a French film director and screenwriter whose career extended over more than six decades.  After training as a film editor in the mid-1940s, he went on to direct a number of short films which included \"Night and Fog\" (1955), an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration camps. \n\nGiovanni Fusco (10 October 1906, Sant'Agata dei Goti, Benevento \u2013 31 May 1968, Rome) was an Italian composer, pianist and conductor, who has written numerous film scores since 1936, including those of Alain Resnais's \"Hiroshima mon amour\" (1959) and \"La guerre est finie\" (1966), as well as of most of the 1948-1964 films directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, from \"N.U.\" (\"Nettezza Urbana\") to \"Il deserto rosso\", except for \"La notte\" (soundtrack by Giorgio Gaslini) and some of his early short films.  Two of his soundtracks, those of Antonioni's \"Cronaca di un amore\" and \"L'avventura\", won Silver Ribbon for the best film score from Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists in 1951 and 1961, respectively. \n\nMuriel (French: Muriel ou le Temps d'un retour , literally \"Muriel, or the Time of a Return\") is a 1963 French film directed by Alain Resnais.  It was Resnais's third feature film, following \"Hiroshima mon amour\" (1959) and \"L'Ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re \u00e0 Marienbad\" (1961), and in common with those films it explores the challenge of integrating a remembered or imagined past with the life of the present.  It also makes oblique reference to the controversial subject of the Algerian War, which had recently been brought to an end.  \"Muriel\" was Resnais's second collaboration with Jean Cayrol, who had also written the screenplay of \"Nuit et brouillard\" (\"Night and Fog\") (1955). \n\nLife of Riley (French: Aimer, boire et chanter ) is a 2014 French comedy-drama film directed by Alain Resnais in his final feature film before his death.  Adapted from the play \"Life of Riley\" by Alan Ayckbourn, the film had its premiere in the competition section of the 64th Berlin International Film Festival, just three weeks before Resnais died, where it won the Alfred Bauer Prize. \n\nHiroshima mon amour (] , \"Hiroshima My Love\"; Japanese: \u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u6642\u9593\u306e\u60c5\u4e8b \"Nij\u016byojikan'noj\u014dji\", \"Twenty-four-hour affair\") is a 1959 drama film directed by French film director Alain Resnais, with a screenplay by Marguerite Duras.  It is the documentation of an intensely personal conversation between a French-Japanese couple about memory and forgetfulness.  It was a major catalyst for the Left Bank Cinema, making highly innovative use of miniature flashbacks to create a uniquely nonlinear storyline. \n\nThe War is Over (French: La Guerre est Finie -1966) is a French drama film about a leftist in Franco's Spain, directed by Alain Resnais and starring Yves Montand, Ingrid Thulin, and Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold.  Joseph Losey directed a sequel, \"Roads to the South\" (French: \"Les Routes du Sud\" -1978). \n\nIsle of Flowers (Portuguese: Ilha das Flores ) is a 1989 Brazilian short film by Jorge Furtado.  It tracks the path of a tomato from garden to dump with the help of a monotone voiceover and a collection of bizarre images.  While a very humorous film, the message it delivers about how human beings treat each other is anything but such.  The director himself has stated that the film was inspired by the works of Kurt Vonnegut and Alain Resnais, among others. \n\nJuli\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez (born 1972 in Mexico City, Mexico as Juli\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez P\u00e9rez) is a Mexican multi-awarded filmmaker.  He won twice the Teddy Award at Berlin Film Festival with his movies\" Thousand Clouds of Peace Fence the Sky, Love, Your Being Love Will Never End \" (2003), and \"Raging Sun, Raging Sky (\"2009).  He studied at the Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematogr\u00e1ficos (CUEC), from where he was expelled due to his gay-themed films during a homophobic administration, and was not mentioned as a serious director until he started winning international recognition.  He has credited his use of cinematographic language to influences from filmmakers such as Michelangelo Antonioni, Leonardo Favio, Robert Bresson, and Alain Resnais.  Hern\u00e1ndez has directed more than 20 awarded short films (both documentaries and fictional), and became a gay-cinema icon for his feature films, including Broken Sky.  Along with producer and director , he founded Cooperativa Cinematogr\u00e1fica Morelos.  which later became the prestigious production company , producing 29 films over two decades. \n\n",

        "context": "Eastern Hills Mall is a shopping mall located at the western border of the Town of Clarence in Erie County, New York, United States.  It lies on Transit Road (New York State Route 78, a 73.49-mile state highway), which in the vicinity of the mall, divides Clarence, New York from the town of Amherst, New York east of (Buffalo, New York).  The mall is north of the junction of NY-78 with NY-5, and Main Street.  The name \"Eastern Hills\" refers to the very low hills that contribute to a slightly higher elevation than the bordering areas along the Onondaga Escarpment.  Eastern Hills Mall is part of a long commercial strip on Transit Road.  It consists of two long wings running north and south and one short wing running east and west, which connects the north-south wings in a \"double L-shaped\" formation.  A major department store is at the end of each wing.  A food court is located adjacent to the end of the long south wing.  A three-screen movie theater showing mainly independent films is also located in the mall, as well as a small New York State Department of Motor Vehicles office.  Surrounding the mall is a large, but generally unkept, parking lot.  The ratio of the mall is so large, it provides the highest parking ratio of any Buffalo area mall.  Much of the parking lot space is leased to area car dealerships to store overstock vehicles due to the low volume of shoppers at the mall.  Eastern Hills Mall is currently at approximately 70% occupancy, with many vacant stores throughout the mall and popular anchor store Dave & Busters shuttering its doors in 2015 to move to the nearby Walden Galleria.  Eastern Hills is considered by many area residents to be a \"dead mall\" and is listed on the website Deadmalls.com.  Most major and nationally recognized retailers have left and been replaced by independently owned \"mom-and-pop\" type stores, selling crafts and homemade goods.  It is common for retailers to open and close within their first few months, unable to turn a profit due to the low volume of shoppers that still visit Eastern Hills Mall. \n\nCitadel Mall, one of the largest shopping malls in the state, is a regional 1138527 sqft shopping mall located in Charleston, South Carolina, United States.  It opened on July 29, 1981 and is located at the intersection of Sam Rittenberg Boulevard (SC Hwy.  7) and I-526.  The mall features more than 100 stores, including six anchor stores: the area's largest Belk and Dillard's department stores, Dick's Sporting Goods, Sears and the region's first Target that was recently remodeled to include a new \"Fresh Grocery\" section.  On September 1, 2013 the mall went into foreclosure after then owner CBL & Associates Properties defaulted on mortgage payments and it was purchased at auction by the lender in January 2014.  After the auction, the mall was placed under the ownership of a holding company formed by the lender, 2070 Sam Rittenberg Boulevard Holdings LLC and as of January 2017 was under contract to be sold to an undisclosed buyer. \n\nHalloween Adventure Stores (also known as Masquerade, LLC) is a retail store chain specializing in Halloween-related merchandise, they are one of the world's largest costuming companies and arguably the largest chain store specializing in Halloween in the United States.  The company was founded in 1981 by brothers Bruce and Darron Goldman in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and has locations in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Florida, and California.  In 2006 there were over 120 \"seasonal stores\", using temporary locations in shopping malls that were vacated for seasonal short-term rentals.

Built in 1975 and expanded several times in its history, it once comprised more than 140 stores, including five anchor stores, a movie theater and a food court.  The mall closed on October 31, 2008, leaving only two of its anchor stores in operation, Sears and JCPenney.  In January 2011, Sears announced their store would close: the Sears store closed in April 2011, while JCPenney converted remaining outlets to \"JC's 5 Star Outlet\" stores.  In 2013, JCPenney announced that it would close all remaining \"JC's Five Star Outlet\" stores, including the store at Rolling Acres.  The store shut its doors on December 31, 2013, leaving the mall vacant of retail stores.  The mall currently houses Storage of America and Pinnacle Recycling.  One of the mall's dilapidated entrances appears as the cover art to The Black Keys' single \"Gold on the Ceiling\".  The mall has been nicknamed \"Rotting Acres Mall\" during its years of abandonment, in reference to the large amount of black mold growing throughout the mall, and the deterioration of the mall since it closed down. \n\nThe Crossings at Northwest, formerly Northwest Plaza, was a shopping mall located in St. Ann, a suburb of St. Louis, Missouri, United States.  The mall comprised nearly 1770000 sqft of gross leasable area, making it the 27th largest mall in the United States according to the International Council of Shopping Centers prior to its closure.  With a total of 1900000 sqft of enclosed space, it was the largest enclosed mall in the state of Missouri.  The mall featured nine anchor stores and more than 210 stores at its peak.  It is currently owned by St. Ann Shopping Center, LLC.  The current plans for the mall include a total demolition, and rebuilding into a lifestyle center.  At the end of 2010, it became the second St Louis area mall to permanently close since 2006.  The first was St. Louis Centre.  Redevelopment of the site begun, including massive demolition and reconstruction, as well as the name change from Northwest Plaza to The Crossings at Northwest. \n\nFedMart was a chain of discount department stores started by Sol Price, who later founded Price Club.  His first location in San Diego, California was in a converted airport hangar.  It was originally a discount department store open to government employees, who paid a membership fee of $2 per family.  FedMart's first year was highly successful.  Over the next 20 years Fedmart grew to include 45 stores in a chain that generated more than $300 million in annual sales.  The business expanded to several states in the Southwest United States.  Many stores were previous White Front or Two Guys locations.  Price later sold two-thirds of the chain to Hugo Mann, a German retail chain, in 1975 and was forced out of his leadership position the following year.  FedMart went out of business in 1982. \n\nWalt Whitman Shops (formerly known as Walt Whitman Mall) is a luxury shopping mall located in Huntington Station, New York on Walt Whitman Road (Route 110) and New York Avenue.  It has many stores including main anchors Bloomingdale's, Lord & Taylor, Macy's and Saks Fifth Avenue.

These stores offer a no-frills experience and warehouse shelving stocked well with merchandise intended to move at higher volumes.  Unlike warehouse clubs, warehouse stores do not require a membership or membership fees. Warehouse stores also offer a selection of merchandise sold in bulk, Typically warehouse stores are laid out in a logical format which leads people a certain way around the store to the checkout.  As one enters the store they are directed down an aisle of discounted special buys when entering the store.  From there the layout typically then leads to the fresh Produce followed by the Deli at the back of the store.  Also included bakery and other departments similar to other supermarkets.  Another typical feature of these stores is that the customer bags their own groceries which also helps to reduce the overall cost.  Many warehouse stores are operated by traditional grocery chains both as a way to attract lower income, value conscious consumers and to maximize their buying power in order to lower costs at their mainstream stores.  Notable examples of corporations who operate warehouse stores include United States chains Kroger and Albertsons LLC and the smaller Sacramento-based Nugget Market.  However, WinCo Foods is an exception as it is a warehouse chain of its own and not part of a larger chain of traditional supermarkets like A&P, Safeway, Kroger, or Supervalu. \n\n",

        "context": "Bard College Berlin (formerly known as ECLA or European College of Liberal Arts) is a private, non-profit institution of higher education in Berlin, Germany.  It was founded as a non-profit association in 1999.  The college is, according to Martha Nussbaum, one of the educational institutions in Europe that makes the liberal arts idea into reality.  Students and faculty come from all over the world and the language of instruction is English.  Qualifying students earn both an American B.A. and a German B.A. \n\nMacalester College ( ) is a private, coeducational liberal arts college located in Saint Paul, Minnesota, US.  It was founded in 1874 as a Presbyterian-affiliated but nonsectarian college.  Its first class entered September 15, 1885.  Macalester is exclusively an undergraduate four-year institution and enrolled 1,978 students in the fall of 2013 from 50 U.S. states and 90 countries.  In 2015, \"U.S. News & World Report\" ranked Macalester as tied for the 23rd best liberal arts college in the United States, 6th for undergraduate teaching at a national liberal arts college, and 19th for best value at a national liberal arts college. \n\nJames Fieser is professor of philosophy at the University of Tennessee at Martin.  He received his B.A. from Berea College, and his M.A. and Ph.D. in philosophy from Purdue University.  He is founder and general editor of the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.  He is author, coauthor or editor of more than ten text books. \n\nWork colleges are distinctive liberal arts colleges in the United States that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service.  At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need.  A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program.  Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs.  At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program.  Students do not have the ability to \"buy\" their way out of the work requirement.  Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community.  Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges).  This, in turn, contributes to lower operational costs which results in lower \u2013 and more affordable \u2013 tuition. \n\nLiberal arts colleges are primarily colleges or universities with an emphasis upon undergraduate study in the liberal arts.  The \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Concise\" offers the following definition of the liberal arts as a, \"college or university curriculum aimed at imparting general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum.\"  Although the genesis for what is known today as the liberal arts college began in Europe, the term is commonly associated with the United States.  Liberal arts colleges are found in countries all over the world as well.  See the list (link) of international members of the Association of American Colleges and Universities for other institutions offering liberal arts education programs. \n\nA liberal arts college is a college with an emphasis on undergraduate study in the liberal arts and sciences.  A liberal arts college aims to impart a broad general knowledge and develop general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum.  Students in a liberal arts college generally major in a particular discipline while receiving exposure to a wide range of academic subjects, including sciences as well as the traditional humanities subjects taught as liberal arts.  Although it draws on European antecedents, the liberal arts college is strongly associated with American higher education, and most liberal arts colleges around the world draw explicitly on the American model. \n\nBerea College is a liberal arts work college in the city of Berea, in the U.S. state of Kentucky.  It is located in Madison County, approximately 35 miles south of Lexington.  Founded in 1855, Berea College is distinctive among post-secondary institutions for providing free education to students and for having been the first college in the Southern United States to be coeducational and racially integrated.  Berea College charges no tuition; every admitted student is provided the equivalent of a four-year, full-tuition scholarship (currently worth $97,200; $24,300 per year). \n\nAlice Lloyd College is a four-year boarding school-style liberal arts work college in Pippa Passes, Kentucky, United States.  It was co-founded by the journalist Alice Spencer Geddes Lloyd, a native of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and June Buchanan, a native of New York City, in 1923, at first under the name of Caney Junior College, as an institution to educate leaders for Appalachia locally.  It became a four-year, bachelor's degree-granting institution in the early 1980s.  Alice Lloyd College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). \n\nAltruism (also called the ethic of altruism, moralistic altruism, and ethical altruism) is an ethical doctrine that holds that the moral value of an individual's actions depend solely on the impact on other individuals, regardless of the consequences on the individual itself.  James Fieser states the altruist dictum as: \"An action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favorable than unfavorable to everyone except the agent.\"  Auguste Comte's version of altruism calls for living for the sake of others.  One who holds to either of these ethics is known as an \"altruist.\" \n\nNancy K. Pearson is an American poet.  She is the author of \"The Whole by Contemplation of a Single Bone\" Fordham University Press, forthcoming 2016 and \"Two Minutes of Light\" Perugia Press, 2008.  Her poems have been published in many literary journals and magazines including Alaska Quarterly, Gulf Coast, The Iowa Review, Black Warrior Review, Indiana Review, Provincetown Arts Magazine, and others.

In the ruling dynasties and noble families of much of Europe and Asia, the family's major assets\u2014realm, titles, fiefs, property and income\u2014have historically been passed from a father to his firstborn son in what is known as primogeniture; younger sons\u2014cadets\u2014inherited less wealth and authority to pass to future generations of descendants. \n\nUnder the Muhammad Ali dynasty, the line of succession to the former Egyptian throne was subject to a number of changes during its history.  From its founding in 1805 until 1866, the dynasty followed the imperial Ottoman practice of agnatic seniority, whereby the eldest male in any generation would succeed to the throne.  In 1866, however, the then Khedive of Egypt Isma'il Pasha obtained a \"firman\" from the Ottoman Emperor which restricted the succession to the male-line descendants of Isma'il Pasha.  The resulting succession remained in force until the abolition of the Egyptian monarchy in 1953, following the 1952 Egyptian Revolution. \n\nBatonishvili (Georgian: \u10d1\u10d0\u10e2\u10dd\u10dc\u10d8\u10e8\u10d5\u10d8\u10da\u10d8 ) (literally \"a child of batoni (lord or sovereign)\" in Georgian) is a title for royal princes and princesses who descend from the kings of Georgia from the Bagrationi dynasty and is suffixed to the names e.g. Alexandre Batonishvili, Ioane Batonishvili, Nino Batonishvili etc.  The title was eventually borne not only by the children of the reigning king (\"mepe\"), but by all male-line descendants of past kings.  The customary attribute or form of address for a Batonishvili was \"\u10e3\u10d2\u10d0\u10dc\u10d0\u10d7\u10da\u10d4\u10d1\u10e3\u10da\u10d4\u10e1\u10d8\" (\"uganatlebulesi\") (\"Most Brilliant\" or \"Most High\"). \n\nDuke of Leuchtenberg was a title created twice by the monarchs of Bavaria for their relatives.  The first creation was awarded by Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria to his son Maximilian Philipp Hieronymus, upon whose death without children the lands passed back to his nephew Elector Maximilian II.  It was re-created by Maximilian I Joseph, King of Bavaria on 14 November 1817 and awarded to his son-in-law Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais.  Eug\u00e8ne was the adopted stepson of the deposed Emperor Napoleon I of France, and Eug\u00e8ne had been his heir in Frankfurt and briefly in Italy.  King Maximilian Joseph compensated his son-in-law after he lost his other titles and named him heir to the kingdom after the male-line descendants of the royal house and next in precedence after the Royal Family. \n\nThe Zulu royal family consists of the reigning monarch of the Zulus of South Africa, King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, his consorts, legitimate descendants, near relatives and male-line descendants of his great-grandfather, King Mpande who, as a half-brother of the Zulu \"Pater Patriae\", King Shaka, reigned from 1840 to 1872.  Shaka's policies and conquests transformed a small clan into one of South Africa's most influential pre-colonial realms, extending over much of what is now KwaZulu-Natal. \n\nThe House of Windsor, the royal house of the Commonwealth realms, includes the male-line descendants of Queen Victoria who are subjects of the Crown (1917 Order-in-Council) and the male-line descendants of Elizabeth II (1952 Order-in-Council).  According to these two Orders-in-Council, male-line female descendants lose the name Windsor upon marriage. \n\nMountbatten-Windsor is the personal surname used by the male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.  Under a declaration made in Privy Council in 1960, the name \"Mountbatten-Windsor\" applies to male-line descendants of the Queen without royal styles and titles.  Individuals with royal styles do not usually use a surname, but some descendants of the Queen with royal styles have used \"Mountbatten-Windsor\" when a surname was required. \n\nThe House of Capet or the Direct Capetians (French: \"Les Cap\u00e9tiens directs, la Maison cap\u00e9tienne\" ), also called the House of France (\"la maison de France\"), or simply the Capets, ruled the Kingdom of France from 987 to 1328.  It was the most senior line of the Capetian dynasty \u2013 itself a derivative dynasty from the Robertians.  Historians in the 19th century came to apply the name \"Capetian\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet.  It was not a contemporary practice (see House of France).  They were sometimes called \"the third race of kings\", the Merovingians being the first, and the Carolingians being the second.  The name is derived from the nickname of Hugh, the first Capetian King, who was known as \"Hugh Capet\". \n\nThe Capetian dynasty , also known as the House of France, is a dynasty of Frankish origin, founded by Hugh Capet.  It is among the largest and oldest royal houses in Europe and the world, and consisting of Hugh Capet's male-line descendants.  The senior line ruled in France as the House of Capet from the election of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of Charles IV in 1328.  They were succeeded by cadet branches, the Houses of Valois and Bourbon, which ruled until the French Revolution. \n\n",

        "context": "The Day the Universe Changed: A Personal View by James Burke is a British documentary television series written and presented by science historian James Burke, originally broadcast on BBC1 from 19 March until 21 May 1985 by the BBC.  The series' primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western society in its philosophical aspects. \n\nRichard Hammond's Engineering Connections is a documentary series originally broadcast on the National Geographic Channel, and later on BBC2.  It is presented by Richard Hammond, and looks at how engineers and designers use historic inventions and clues from the natural world in ingenious ways to develop new buildings and machines.  The show's format is very similar to that of James Burke's 1978 documentary series, \"Connections\".  The first series premi\u00e8red on 8 September 2008, on National Geographic, and on 1 March 2010, on BBC2.  The first series contained four episodes.  The second series premi\u00e8red on 7 September 2009, on National Geographic, and on 8 May 2010, on BBC2.  The second series contained six episodes.  The third series premi\u00e8red on 8 May 2011, on BBC2 and contained six episodes.  The BBC2 broadcasts of the first two series have a slightly shorter running time and contain less information than the original National Geographic broadcasts, with on average one minute of footage cut from every episode.  None of the three series of the programme are available to purchase on DVD in the UK, however, all three can be watched on demand for subscribers of National Geographic on Sky, Virgin Media and BT Vision.  In Australia, all three series are available on DVD, either separately or as a box-set. \n\nConnections is a 10-episode documentary television series and 1978 book (\"Connections\", based on the series) created, written, and presented by science historian James Burke.  The series was produced and directed by Mick Jackson of the BBC Science and Features Department and first aired in 1978 (UK) and 1979 (USA).  It took an interdisciplinary approach to the history of science and invention, and demonstrated how various discoveries, scientific achievements, and historical world events were built from one another successively in an interconnected way to bring about particular aspects of modern technology.  The series was noted for Burke's crisp and enthusiastic presentation (and dry humour), historical re-enactments, and intricate working models. \n\nSci Fi Science: Physics of the Impossible (also called Science of the Impossible) is an American documentary television series on Science which first aired in the United States on December 1, 2009.  The series is hosted by theoretical physicist Michio Kaku and is based on his book \"Physics of the Impossible\".  In each episode, Dr. Kaku addresses a technological concept from science fiction and designs his own theoretical version of the technology using currently-known science.  He also visits scientists developing technology related to the episode's concept. \n\nNational Geographic Explorer (or simply Explorer) is an American documentary television series that originally premiered on Nickelodeon on April 7, 1985, after having been produced as a less costly and intensive alternative to PBS's \"National Geographic Specials\" by Pittsburgh station WQED.  The first episode (\"Herculaneum: Voices from the Past\") was produced by WQED and featured long-time \"Explorer\" camerman Mark Knobil, who is the few staff members with the franchise during all 24 seasons.  The program is the longest-running documentary television series on cable television.  Presented every Sunday from 5:00 pm to 8:00 pm, the original series was three hours in length, containing five to ten short films.  Although the National Geographic Society had been producing specials for television for 20 years prior to \"Explorer\", the premiere of the series required an increase in production from 4 hours of programming a year to 156 hours.  Tim Cowling and Tim Kelly were the executive producers for the series during this transition. \n\nFreaky Eaters is an American documentary television series based on the BBC series of the same name that aired on TLC. \n\nRipley's Believe It or Not!  is the name of several documentary television series based on the newspaper feature.  The first series aired on NBC from 1949 to 1950, and was hosted by Robert L. Ripley until his death, after which several substitute hosts filled in.  The series was revived for ABC in the 1980s, and was hosted primarily by Jack Palance.  Another revival debuted on TBS in 2000, and aired until 2003, with Dean Cain as host.  A Filipino version, hosted by Chris Tiu, debuted in 2008.  An animated series based on the \"Ripley's\" franchise was also created. \n\nJames Burke (born 22 December 1936) is a British broadcaster, science historian, author, and television producer, who is known, among other things, for his documentary television series \"Connections\" (1978), and for its more philosophically oriented companion series, \"The Day the Universe Changed\" (1985), which is about the history of science and technology.  \"The Washington Post\" called him \"one of the most intriguing minds in the Western world\". \n\nAaron Faulls (born February 6, 1975), is an American television personality, filmmaker, musician and marine conservationist.  He is best known for his role as the original host of the television series Into The Drink, a Travel documentary-style series based around Faulls's background as an underwater filmmaker and journalist.  He is also known for his appearances on \"Gangland\", a documentary television series on the History Channel. \n\nCosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey is a 2014 American science documentary television series.  The show is a follow-up to the 1980 television series \"\", which was presented by Carl Sagan on the Public Broadcasting Service and is considered a milestone for scientific documentaries.  This series was developed to bring back the foundation of science to network television at the height of other scientific-based television series and films.  The show is presented by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who, as a young high school student, was inspired by Sagan.  Among the executive producers are Seth MacFarlane, whose financial investment was instrumental in bringing the show to broadcast television, and Ann Druyan, a co-author and co-creator of the original television series and Sagan's wife.  The show is produced by Brannon Braga, and Alan Silvestri composed the backing score. \n\n",

The village was designated as an International Slow City in 2010 in recognition of its relaxed pace of life where traditional culture and nature blend harmoniously.  The number of visitors to Jeonju Hanok Village has increased sharply since the 2000s.  The visitor numbers more than doubled from 2007 to 2014, from 3.17 million to 7.89 million.

        "context": "The Magic Christian is a 1959 comic novel by American author Terry Southern (1924\u20131995) about an odd billionaire who spends most of his time playing elaborate practical jokes on people.  It is known for bringing Southern to the attention of filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who had received a copy as a gift from Peter Sellers, and subsequently hired him as co-writer for \"Dr. Strangelove\" (1964) when Kubrick decided to make that film a black comedy/satire, rather than a straightforward thriller.  In 1969, \"The Magic Christian\" was made into a film starring Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr; the story was much altered and relocated from New York City to London. \n\nJaroslav Ha\u0161ek (] ; April 30, 1883 \u2013 January 3, 1923) was a Czech writer, humorist, satirist, journalist, bohemian and anarchist.  He is best known for his novel \"The Good Soldier \u0160vejk\", an unfinished collection of farcical incidents about a soldier in World War I and a satire on the ineptitude of authority figures.  The novel has been translated into about 60 languages, making it the most translated novel in Czech literature.  He is also known as the Obscure Czech Writer. \n\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gironella Pous (31 December 1917 in Darnius \u2013 3 January 2003 in Arenys de Mar) was a Spanish author best known for his fictional work \"The Cypresses Believe in God\" (\"Los cipreses creen en Dios\"), which was published in Spain in 1953 and translated into English by Harriet de On\u00eds in 1955.  The book is a novel in two parts, and is the first novel of four, written from a Roman Catholic viewpoint, by its Catholic author, who had been educated in a seminary \u2014 but whose approach is notable for its even-handedness and fair assessment of the many nuances and subtleties among all factions on the eve of war.  The story is set in Girona, a city in eastern Catalonia, and follows the life of a family, from 1931 until the Spanish Civil War breaks out in 1936.  The protagonist is the son of an atheist from Madrid, who is married to a devout Basque woman, and has a younger brother and sister also caught up in the conflict.  In a sequel to \"Cypresses\", \"One Million Dead\" (\"Un mill\u00f3n de muertos\"), translated by Joan MacLean, Gironella follows the Alvear family through the war.  The next novel is \"Peace after War\", published in English in 1969, and was also translated by MacLean.  The fourth novel, Los hombres lloran solos (Men cry alone), has not been translated and published in English. \n\nStanis\u0142aw Herman Lem (] ; 12 or 13 September 1921 \u2013 27 March 2006) was a Polish writer of science fiction, philosophy, and satire, and a trained physician.  Lem's books have been translated into forty-one languages and have sold over forty-five million copies.  From the 1950s to 2000s, he published many books, both science fiction and philosophical/futurological.  He is best known as the author of the 1961 novel \"Solaris\", which has been made into a feature film three times.  In 1976, Theodore Sturgeon wrote that Lem was the most widely read science fiction writer in the world. \n\nJoanna Russ (February 22, 1937 \u2013 April 29, 2011) was an American writer, academic and radical feminist.  She is the author of a number of works of science fiction, fantasy and feminist literary criticism such as \"How to Suppress Women's Writing\", as well as a contemporary novel, \"On Strike Against God\", and one children's book, \"Kittatinny\".  She is best known for \"The Female Man\", a novel combining utopian fiction and satire, and the story \"When It Changed\". \n\nLord Simon R. Taylor (born 14 December 1988) is a Scottish author, editor, play right and critic.  He is best known for his fantasy novel \"Fairydust\", and his long-running spy satire \"Monday: Impossible\". \n\nLittle Big Man is a 1964 novel by American author Thomas Berger.  Often described as a satire or parody of the western genre, the book is a modern example of picaresque fiction.  Berger made use of a large volume of overlooked first-person primary materials, such as diaries, letters, and memoirs, to fashion a wide-ranging and entertaining tale that comments on alienation, identity, and perceptions of reality.  Easily Berger's best known work, \"Little Big Man\" was made into a popular film by Arthur Penn.  It has been called \"Berger's response to the great American myth of the frontier, representing as it does most of the central traditions of American literature.\" \n\nHugh Gallagher is an author and musician from New York City.  He is best known for his satire, including his band Von Von Von, his award-winning satire on the college application essay, \"3A Essay\", and the novel \"Teeth\". \n\nClaudia Durst Johnson is a literary scholar best known for her work on the novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", introducing the idea of the novel's gothicism and gothic satire.  In the process of her research she befriended the author, Harper Lee.  When the city of Chicago organized a One City One Book program in 2001 based on \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", Lee was unavailable to speak, so Johnson was invited to Chicago to present the book to the city. \n\nThe Satyricon, or Satyricon \"liber\" (\"The Book of Satyrlike Adventures\"), is a Latin work of fiction believed to have been written by Gaius Petronius, though the manuscript tradition identifies the author as a certain Titus Petronius.  The Satyricon is an example of Menippean satire, which is very different from the formal verse satire of Juvenal or Horace.  The work contains a mixture of prose and verse (commonly known as \"prosimetrum\"); serious and comic elements; and erotic and decadent passages.  As with the \"Metamorphoses\" (also called \"The Golden Ass\") of Apuleius, classical scholars often describe it as a \"Roman novel\", without necessarily implying continuity with the modern literary form. \n\n",

Pakistan's Sindh province abounds in fairy-tales and folktales that form its folklore.  Some of these folktales(\u0642\u0635\u0627) are particularly important for the development of higher literature in Sindhi, since they were to form the core of mystical tales of Sindh immortalized by Shah Abdul latif Bhittai, and are generally known as Heroines of Shah (\u0634\u0627\u0647 \u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0633\u0648\u0631\u0645\u064a\u0648\u0646). \n\nThe Greek Princess and the Young Gardener is an Irish fairy tale collected by Patrick Kennedy in \"Fireside Stories of Ireland\".

He is the younger brother of the late musician Bap Kennedy. \n\nJack and his Comrades is a short Irish fairy tale describing the title character's story of success with the help of his animal helpers, collected by folklorist Patrick Kennedy from a resident of County Wexford, Ireland, and published in \"Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts\" (1866).  It was later reprinted, revised but only slightly, by Joseph Jacobs in his Celtic fairy tale compilation. \n\nPatrick Kennedy (early 1801 \u2013 29 March 1873) was a folklorist from Co.  Wexford, Ireland.  A bookseller by trade, he is known for his collections of Irish (Leinster) folktales.  The tales are told in rusticated English of the Irish peasantry who had established roots in The Pale, the anglicized part of Ireland.  He is \"widely credited with preserving irish idioms in the turn of phrase, sentence structure, Irish words\". \n\nSeumas MacManus (31 December 1867 \u2013 23 October 1960) was an Irish author, dramatist, and poet known for his ability to reinterpret Irish folktales for modern audiences. \n\nIrish Fairy Tales is a retelling of ten Irish folktales by the Irish author James Stephens.  The English illustrator Arthur Rackham provided interior artwork, including numerous black and white illustrations and sixteen color plates.  The stories are set in a wooded, Medieval Ireland filled with larger-than-life hunters, warriors, kings, and fairies.  Many stories concern the Fianna and their captain, Fionn mac Uail, from the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology. \n\nPatrick Kennedy (February 16, 1823 \u2013 November 22, 1858) was an Irish farmer, businessman, and politician who moved to East Boston, Massachusetts from County Wexford, Ireland.  He was born in New Ross, Ireland.  He was the father of businessman/politician P. J. Kennedy, paternal grandfather of businessman/politician Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., and patrilineal great-grandfather of World War II casualty Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and longtime Senator Ted Kennedy. \n\nThe Brown Bear of Norway is an Irish fairy tale collected by Patrick Kennedy which appeared in his \"Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts\" (1866).  It was later included by Andrew Lang in his anthology \"The Lilac Fairy Book\" (1910), though Lang misattributed his source as \"West Highland Tales\" (cf. The Brown Bear of the Green Glen). \n\nAmy Corzine is an American fiction and non-fiction writer and poet.  Her first book was a Cadogan travel guide to Ireland for families in which she included stories she wrote based on Irish folktales.  After that, Watkins Publishing commissioned her for 'The Secret Life of the Universe: The Quest for the Soul of Science'.  Then Classical Comics asked her to adapt Charlotte Bront\u00eb's 'Jane Eyre' into graphic novel form. \n\n",

        "context": "Romeo and Juliet is a 1954 film adaptation of William Shakespeare's play of the same name.  It was directed by Renato Castellani and stars Laurence Harvey as Romeo, Susan Shentall as Juliet, Flora Robson as the Nurse, Mervyn Johns as Friar Laurence, Bill Travers as Benvolio, Sebastian Cabot as Lord Capulet, Ubaldo Zollo as Mercutio, Enzo Fiermonte as Tybalt and John Gielgud as the Chorus. \n\nRomeo Montague (Italian: \"Romeo Montecchi\" ) is the protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\".  The son of Montague and his wife, he secretly loves and marries Juliet, a member of the rival House of Capulet.  Forced into exile after slaying Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, in a duel, Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet's death. \n\nRory Williams is a fictional character portrayed by Arthur Darvill in the long-running British science fiction television series \"Doctor Who\".  Having been introduced at the start of the 5th series, Rory joins the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) as a companion in the middle of Series 5.  As Amy Pond's fianc\u00e9, Rory is initially insecure because he believes Amy secretly loves the Doctor more.  Later, however, he proves to be a hero in his own right and he and Amy marry.  The couple conceive a daughter aboard the Doctor's time machine, the TARDIS, while in the time vortex, but their baby is kidnapped at birth.  In \"A Good Man Goes to War\", Rory and Amy discover their time-traveler friend River Song is actually their daughter Melody Pond.  The Doctor and River marry in \"The Wedding of River Song\", and Rory becomes the Doctor's father-in-law. \n\nBenvolio is a fictional character in Shakespeare's drama \"Romeo and Juliet\".  He is Montague's nephew and Romeo's cousin.  Benvolio serves as an unsuccessful peacemaker in the play, attempting to prevent violence between the Capulet and Montague families. \n\nMacbeth ( ; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606.  It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake.  Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, \"Macbeth\" most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign.  It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy. \n\nJuliet Capulet (Italian: \"Giulietta Capuleti\" ) is the female protagonist in William Shakespeare's romantic tragedy \"Romeo and Juliet\".  Juliet is the only daughter of the patriarch of the House of Capulet and falls in love with Romeo, a member of the House of Montague (with which the Capulets have a blood feud).  The story has a long history that precedes Shakespeare himself. \n\nPrince Hamlet is the title character and protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy \"Hamlet\".  He is the Prince of Denmark, nephew to the usurping Claudius, and son of King Hamlet, the previous King of Denmark.  At the beginning of the play, he struggles with whether, and how, to avenge the murder of his father, and struggles with his own sanity along the way.  By the end of the tragedy, Hamlet has caused the deaths of Polonius, Laertes, Claudius, and two acquaintances of his from the University of Wittenberg Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  He is also indirectly involved in the deaths of his love Ophelia (drowning) and of his mother Gertrude (poisoned by Claudius by mistake). \n\nShakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare.  Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the History of England, they were classified as \"histories\" in the First Folio.  The Roman tragedies\u2014\"Julius Caesar\", \"Antony and Cleopatra\" and \"Coriolanus\"\u2014are also based on historical figures, but because their source stories were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories.  Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy.  They share some elements of tragedy featuring a high status central character but end happily like Shakespearean comedies.  Several hundred years after Shakespeare's death, scholar F.S. Boas also coined a fifth category, the \"problem play,\" for plays that don't fit neatly into a single classification because of their subject matter, setting, or ending.  The classifications of certain Shakespeare plays are still debated among scholars. \n\nAnna Devane is a fictional character from the original ABC Daytime soap opera, \"General Hospital\", played by Finola Hughes.  Hughes also appeared as Anna on \"All My Children\", and the \"General Hospital\" prime time, spin-off series, \"\".  The character first appeared on the April 10, 1985 episode of \"General Hospital\" as a fence.  The character was created and introduced by executive producer, Gloria Monty, and co-head writers, Pat Falken Smith and Norma Monty.  Upon her introduction, Anna is revealed to be the super spy ex-wife of Robert Scorpio and romantic rival to his current wife, Holly Sutton.  Anna remained a prominent character in the series until 1992 due to her romantic pairings with Robert and former mobster, Duke Lavery.  The storyline in which Duke tries to evade his criminal past with the Jerome family, allows for Duke and Anna to become one of the show's supercouples, along with Robert and Anna.  However, the storyline ends in tragedy when Duke dies in Anna's arms.  Robert and Anna eventually reunite to raise their daughter, Robin, and eventually remarry; the happiness is short lived and the duo are killed off in 1992 along with their rival, Cesar Faison. \n\nRevenge tragedy (less commonly referred to as revenge drama, revenge play, or tragedy of blood) defines a genre of plays made popular in early modern England.  Ashley H. Thorndike formally established this genre in his seminal 1902 article \"The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays,\" which characterizes revenge tragedy \"as a tragedy whose leading motive is revenge and whose main action deals with the progress of this revenge, leading to the death of the murderers and often the death of the avenger himself.\"  Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\" (c.1580s) is often considered the inaugural revenge tragedy on the early modern stage.  However, more recent research extends early modern revenge tragedy to the 1560s with poet and classicist Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca at Oxford University, including \"Troas\" (1559), \"Thyestes\" (1560), and \"Hercules Furens\" (1561).  Additionally, Thomases Norton and Sackville's play \"Gorbuduc\" (1561) is considered an early revenge tragedy (almost twenty years prior to \"The Spanish Tragedy\").  Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (c.1599-1602) and \"Titus Andronicus\" (c.1588-1593) and Thomas Middleton's \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" (c.1606). \n\n",

Spungen's life and death have been the subject of controversy among music historians and fans of the Sex Pistols. \n\nLive at Winterland 1978 is a live album by the Avengers.  It was released through online music stores on February 16, 2010.  The album features a recording of their set on January 14, 1978 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, CA, when they opened for the Sex Pistols on what would become the Sex Pistols final show, before reuniting years later.  The Sex Pistols' set has been released on an album of the same name.  Songs from this album were previously released on a couple 7\" bootlegs titled \"Penelope\" and \"Summer of Hate\". \n\nThe Flowers of Romance were an early punk band, formed in mid-1976 by Jo Faull and Sarah Hall.  The band never played live or released any recordings, and, like London SS and Masters of the Backside, are more famed for the number of band members that later became well known, including: Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, Keith Levene (an early member of The Clash and later of Public Image Ltd) and Palmolive and Viv Albertine, who went on to play in The Slits.  Despite never playing live, they were interviewed by a fanzine named \"SKUM\", in which Sid Vicious proclaimed \"I'll just be the yob that I am now\". \n\n\"Revolution in the Classroom\" was a single released by the Ex Pistols; despite its packaging, the record has nothing to do with the Sex Pistols.  The single was released in 1989 on the STP Records label, pressed on various colours of vinyl.  The song, along with its B-side \"Schools Are Prisons\", were both included on the Ex-Pistols album, \"Deny\".  They also appear disguised as genuine Sex Pistols recordings on two Sex Pistols retrospective albums by former producer Dave Goodman, \"Pirates of Destiny\" (I Swirled Records, 1989) and \"We Have Cum For Your Children\" (Skyclad Records, 1988). Under the title \"Revolution\" the song appears on a German Sex Pistols compilation \"Anarchy in the USA\" from 1992 released on MBC records.  CD 084-60322 LP 008-60321 \n\nThe Ex Pistols were a scam act introduced in 1979 by one-time Sex Pistols producer Dave Goodman after his services were substituted for those of professional producers.  The Ex Pistols existed as a sound-alike band meant to mislead fans due to the similar music, name, and artwork, that led people to believe their songs were actually new or lost Sex Pistols recordings. \n\nGlen Matlock (born 27 August 1956) is an English musician best known for being the bass guitarist in the original line-up of the punk rock band the Sex Pistols.  He is sometimes credited as a co-author on 10 of the 12 songs on \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\", although he had left the band by the time the record was released and the bass was played by Steve Jones.  He also continues to make his own records and tour with various bands, including the Sex Pistols. \n\n\"Bodies\" is a Sex Pistols song about the shock of abortion from the 1977 album \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\".  The lyrics contain very graphic imagery about a terminated fetus and feature a great deal of profanity for the time: the third and final verse begins with a couplet in which the word \"fuck\" is repeated five times in rapid succession.  Along with the later \"Belsen Was a Gas,\" it is probably the most graphic and controversial Sex Pistols song in both its subject matter and style.  Musically, it is also the fastest and heaviest song in the Sex Pistols canon \u2014 characterized by thudding drums, droning buzzsaw guitar, and shouted vocals.  As such, it can be considered a significant antecedent to the genres of hardcore, thrash, and speed metal that was to emerge in the 1980s. \n\nThe Swindle Continues is the first album released by the Ex Pistols in 1988.  It consists of half Sex Pistols and half Ex Pistols material, and is the only Ex Pistols release that doesn't disguise itself as material completely by the Sex Pistols. \n\nThe Idols with Sid Vicious is a concert album of former Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious performing with The Idols; though recorded in September 1978, it wasn't released until 1993.  Steve Dior provided a recording of this performance to the New Rose record label.  It was originally released by the Fan Club division of New Rose.  It was also released in Japan by Teichiku Records, under license from New Rose. \n\nThe Sham Pistols were a short-lived punk rock supergroup composed of guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook of the Sex Pistols with vocalist Jimmy Pursey and bass player Dave Tregunna of Sham 69.  Although now referred to as The Sham Pistols no name had been decided upon at the time.  There was the possibility that they may have been called The Sex Pistols. \n\n",

        "context": "Docking is the intentional removal of part of an animal's tail or, sometimes, ears.  The term cropping is more commonly used in reference to the cropping of ears, while \"docking\" more commonly\u2014but not exclusively\u2014refers to the tail.  The term tailing is also commonly used.  The term arises because the living flesh of the tail, from which the animal's tail hairs grow, commonly is known as the dock. \n\nA STOLport or STOLPORT was an airport designed with STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing) operations in mind, usually for an aircraft class of its weight and size.  The term STOLport did not appear to be in common usage as of 2008 although was commonly used by pilots flying into Biggin Hill during 1986/87 when the London City airport was opened restricting approaches and ceilings to the north of Biggin.  A STOLport normally had a short single runway, in general shorter than 5000 ft .  STOLports only accepted certain types of aircraft, often only smaller propeller aircraft, often with limits on the amount of fuel that can be taken.  In the United States, short runway facilities are simply known as airports and the term STOLport has not been commonly used since the early 1970s. \n\nTrickle valves, also known as vacuum valves, are commonly used in industrial dust collection applications to maintain an airlock seal on a dust collector hopper while allowing bulk solid material to be automatically discharged.  These valves are typically a less expensive alternative to more commonly used rotary airlocks.  Unlike rotary airlock valves which are driven by either an electric motor or a gas or air-powered motor, trickle valves require no external power source and are therefore well-suited for use in mechanical trenchers, where a dust-free environment in the pinnacle truss and axle bore is required for smooth operation.  Trickle values were originally developed for this purpose. \n\nThe Belling-Lee connector or IEC 61169-2 radio-frequency coaxial connector of type 9,52, known colloquially in countries where it is used as a TV antenna connector as a PAL antenna connector, IEC antenna connector, or simply as a TV aerial plug, is commonly used in Europe and Australia to connect coaxial cables with each other and with terrestrial VHF/UHF roof antennas, antenna signal amplifiers, CATV distribution equipment, TV sets, and FM and DAB radio receivers.  It is one of the oldest coaxial connectors still commonly used in consumer devices. \n\n\"Pox\" is a liquor commonly used for ceremonial purposes among the Mayans of Mexico and Central America.  \"Pox\" is a liquor made of corn, sugar cane and wheat, very important in mayan culture for its ceremonial uses and is also known as aguardiente.  Besides its religious significance it is also a somewhat popular alcoholic drink in the Chiapas region of Southern Mexico.  The word \"pox\" in Tzotzil means \"medicine, cane liquor, cure.\"  Pox was commonly used in religious ceremonies and festivals in San Juan Chamula, Chiapas, but increasingly soda has been substituted for it. \n\nYogurt, yoghurt, or yoghourt ( or ; from Turkish: \"yo\u011furt\" ; other spellings listed below) is a food produced by bacterial fermentation of milk.  The bacteria used to make yogurt are known as \"yogurt cultures\".  Fermentation of lactose by these bacteria produces lactic acid, which acts on milk protein to give yogurt its texture and characteristic tart flavor.  Cow's milk is commonly available worldwide, and, as such, is the milk most commonly used to make yogurt.  Milk from water buffalo, goats, ewes, mares, camels, and yaks is also used to produce yogurt where available locally.  Milk used may be homogenized or not (milk distributed in many parts of the world is homogenized); both types may be used, with substantially different results. \n\nTensile testing, also known as tension testing, is a fundamental materials science test in which a sample is subjected to a controlled tension until failure.  The results from the test are commonly used to select a material for an application, for quality control, and to predict how a material will react under normal forces. Properties that are directly measured via a tensile test are ultimate tensile strength, maximum elongation and reduction in area.  From these measurements the following properties can also be determined: Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength, and strain-hardening characteristics.  Uniaxial tensile testing is the most commonly used for obtaining the mechanical characteristics of isotropic materials.  For anisotropic materials, such as composite materials and textiles, biaxial tensile testing is required. \n\nMetandienone (INN) (brand names Averbol, Dianabol, Danabol, Metanabol, Naposim, Vetanabol), or methandienone (BAN), also commonly known as methandrostenolone, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a 17\u03b1-methylated derivative of testosterone which was formerly used medically but has since been discontinued in most countries.  It has also seen non-medical use as a performance-enhancing drug. \n\nHomeschooling, also known as home education, is the education of children inside the home.  Home education is usually conducted by a parent or tutor.  Many families use less formal ways of educating.  \"Homeschooling\" is the term commonly used in North America, whereas \"home education\" is commonly used in the United Kingdom, Europe, and in many Commonwealth countries. \n\nMethyltestosterone (brand names Agovirin, Android, Metandren, Oreton, Testred, Virilon, others) is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) which is used in the treatment of androgen deficiency in males and for a number of other indications.  It is also used illicitly for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes by athletes and bodybuilders.  The drug was synthesized in 1935 shortly following the discovery of testosterone, and was one of the first synthetic AAS to be developed.  Although it is not as commonly used as other AAS for various reasons, methyltestosterone continues to be used medically even today. \n\n",

Davis, General Hammond serves as the commander of Stargate Command (SGC) in the first seven seasons of the television series \"Stargate SG-1\".  He is relieved of command in the series' season 7 finale \"Lost City\", but becomes head of the new Homeworld Security department at the beginning of season 8.  Hammond's off-screen retirement is confirmed in \"SG-1\"' s season 10, and the character's death is mentioned in the series finale of \"SG-1\"' s spin-off series \"Stargate Atlantis\", \"Enemy at the Gate\". \n\nStargate SG-1 (often abbreviated as SG-1) is an adventure and military science fiction television series and part of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's \"Stargate\" franchise.  The show, created by Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner, is based on the 1994 science fiction film \"Stargate\" by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich.  The television series was filmed in and around the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  The series premiered on Showtime on July 27, 1997 and moved to the Sci Fi Channel on June 7, 2002; the final episode first aired on Sky1 on March 13, 2007.  With 214 episodes over ten seasons, \"Stargate SG-1\" had surpassed \"The X-Files\" as the longest-running North American science fiction television series, until it was surpassed by the series \"Smallville\" in 2011. \n\nVala Mal Doran is a fictional character in the American military science fiction television series \"Stargate SG-1\", a science fiction show about a military team exploring the galaxy via a network of alien transportation devices.  Played by former \"Farscape\" actress Claudia Black, Vala was created by Damian Kindler and Robert C. Cooper as a guest character for the season 8 episode \"Prometheus Unbound\" (2004).  Because of the on-screen chemistry between Black's Vala and Michael Shanks' character Daniel Jackson, and the character's popularity with the producers and the audience, Claudia Black became a recurring guest star in season 9 (2005\u20132006) and joined the main cast in season 10 (2006\u20132007). \n\nDon Sinclair Davis, PhD (August 4, 1942\u00a0\u2013 June 29, 2008) was an American character actor best-known for playing General Hammond in the television series \"Stargate SG-1\" (1997\u20132007), and earlier for playing Major Garland Briggs on the television series \"Twin Peaks\" (1990\u20131991).  He was also a theater professor, painter, and United States Army captain. \n\nStargate: Continuum is a 2008 Canadian-American military science fiction direct-to-video film in the \"Stargate\" franchise.  It is the second sequel to television series \"Stargate SG-1\" following \"\".  It is directed by Martin Wood, director and producer of many episodes of \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Stargate Atlantis\", written by \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" creator Brad Wright, and produced by Wright and \"Ark of Truth\" director Robert C. Cooper. \n\n\"Lost City\" is the two-part finale to the seventh season of the science fiction television show \"Stargate SG-1\".  It was originally intended to be a second \"Stargate\" film, and was then to be the show's absolute finale, and finally ended up being the seventh season finale after the series was renewed.  \"Lost City\" served as an introduction to \"Stargate Atlantis\" and the events portrayed were followed up in the \"Atlantis\" premiere \"Rising\" as well as in \"SG-1\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s own \"New Order\".  \"Lost City\" also featured special guest star Chief of Staff of the Air Force John P.

This episode was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series and for a Gemini Award in the category Best Visual Effects. \n\nSamantha \"Sam\" Carter, USAF is a fictional character in the Canadian\u2013American military science fiction \"Stargate\" franchise.  Played by Amanda Tapping, she appears in all three shows in the franchise: \"Stargate SG-1\", \"Stargate Atlantis\", and \"Stargate Universe\".  She was a main character in all ten seasons of \"Stargate SG-1\" (1997\u20132007).  Following a recurring role in \"Stargate Atlantis\" for three seasons (2004\u201307), Carter became a main character in Season 4 of \"Atlantis\" (2007\u201308), and also appeared in the 2008 direct-to-DVD \"SG-1\" films \"\" and \"\".  Amanda Tapping accepted a starring role in \"Sanctuary\" and appears in only the first and last episodes in Season 5 of \"Atlantis\" (2008\u201309).  Carter also appears in two episodes of Season 1 of \"Stargate Universe.\" \n\nSeason eight of \"Stargate SG-1\", an American-Canadian military science fiction television series, began airing on July 9, 2004 on the Sci Fi channel.  The eighth season concluded on February 22, 2005, after 20 episodes on British Sky One, which overtook the Sci Fi Channel in mid-season.  This was the first season of the show to have 20 episodes instead of 22, as well as the first to air concurrently with \"Stargate SG-1\" spinoff series \"Stargate Atlantis\" (the first season thereof).  The series was originally developed by Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner, while Brad Wright and Robert C. Cooper served as executive producers.  Season eight regular cast members include Richard Dean Anderson, Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge, and Michael Shanks.  The eighth season begins with the SG-1 team trying to revive Colonel Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) after the events of the seventh season.  At the end of the two-episode season opener, Colonel O'Neill is promoted to General and assumes command of Stargate Command (SGC), while Major Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) is promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and assumes command of SG-1.  The season arc centers on the growing threat and seemingly final defeat of the Goa'uld and the Replicators, races who were introduced in the first and third season of the show, respectively. \n\nThe first season of the military science fiction television series \"Stargate SG-1\" commenced airing on the Showtime channel in the United States on July 27, 1997, concluded on the same channel on March 6, 1998, and contained 22 episodes.  The show itself is a spin off from the 1994 hit movie, \"Stargate\" written by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich.  Stargate SG-1 re-introduced supporting characters from the film universe, such as Jonathan \"Jack\" O'Neill and Daniel Jackson and included new characters such as Teal'c, George Hammond and Samantha \"Sam\" Carter.  The first season was about a military-science expedition team discovering how to use the ancient device, named the Stargate, to explore the galaxy.  However, they encountered a powerful enemy in the film named the Goa'uld, which is bent on destroying Earth and all that oppose them. \n\nThe two-part episode \"Redemption\" is the Season 6 premiere of the science fiction television series \"Stargate SG-1\".  Airing on June 7 and June 14, 2002, it was the first all-new \"SG-1\" episode to be broadcast by SCI FI, the new home of \"SG-1\" after the series' move from Showtime.  The episode was written by producer Robert C. Cooper, and directed by Martin Wood.  \"Redemption\" is the first episode where actor Corin Nemec had main cast status, his character Jonas Quinn replacing Daniel Jackson (played by Michael Shanks) who died at the end of season 5.  The episode also marks the second appearance of David Hewlett's character Rodney McKay, who later became a main character on \"Stargate Atlantis\".  \"Redemption Part 2\" was nominated for a Gemini Award in the category \"Best Visual Effects\". \n\n",

It is the largest residential tree care company in North America and was founded in 1880 making it the first national tree care company.  John Davey, its founder, is considered the father of the science of tree surgery and arboriculture.  The company's core services include tree, utility services, large tree moving, commercial grounds management and consulting services.  It has been employee owned since 1979 and is the largest employee-owned company in the state of Ohio and one of the top 20 largest in the United States.  Davey is organized in two segments, Residential and Commercial, and Utility. \n\nNitrogen assimilation is the formation of organic nitrogen compounds like amino acids from inorganic nitrogen compounds present in the environment.  Organisms like plants, fungi and certain bacteria that cannot fix nitrogen gas (N) depend on the ability to assimilate nitrate or ammonia for their needs.  Other organisms, like animals, depend entirely on organic nitrogen from their food. \n\nThe Bottle tree (\"Pachypodium lealii\" Welw.)  is a species of plant included in the \"genus\" \"Pachypodium\".  The scientific name derives from the 19th century Portuguese geologist Fernando da Costa Leal, who described the Bottle tree during an exploration in southern Angola. \n\nParkia timoriana is a species of flowering plant in the legume family.  English common names include tree bean.  Common names in other languages and regions include petai hutan in Borneo, yongchak in Manipur, India, nitta tree and riang in Thailand, kedawung and peundung in Java, alai in Sumatra, petai kerayong and batai hutan in Malaysia, and kupang and amarang in the Philippines.  It is native to Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, and Assam in India.  It is widely cultivated for food and wood, and as an ornamental. \n\nIn computer science, a Fractal Tree index is a tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches and sequential access in the same time as a B-tree but with insertions and deletions that are asymptotically faster than a B-tree.  Like a B-tree, a Fractal Tree index is a generalization of a binary search tree in that a node can have more than two children.  Furthermore, unlike a B-tree, a Fractal Tree index has buffers at each node, which allow insertions, deletions and other changes to be stored in intermediate locations.  The goal of the buffers is to schedule disk writes so that each write performs a large amount of useful work, thereby avoiding the worst-case performance of B-trees, in which each disk write may change a small amount of data on disk.  Like a B-tree, Fractal Tree indexes are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data.  The Fractal Tree index has been commercialized in databases by Tokutek.  Originally, it was implemented as a cache-oblivious lookahead array, but the current implementation is an extension of the B tree.  The B is related to the Buffered Repository Tree.  The Buffered Repository Tree has degree 2, whereas the B tree has degree B.  The Fractal Tree index has also been used in a prototype filesystem.  An open source implementation of the Fractal Tree index is available, which demonstrates the implementation details outlined below. \n\nA weak heap is a combination of the binary heap and binomial heap data structures for implementing priority queues.  It can be stored in an array as an implicit binary tree like the former, and has the efficiency guarantees of the latter. \n\nCoprosma repens is a species of flowering shrub or small tree of the genus \"Coprosma\", in the family Rubiaceae, native to New Zealand.  Common names include tree bedstraw, taupata, mirror bush, looking-glass bush, New Zealand laurel and shiny leaf. \n\nDurvillaea willana is a kelp species.  It is similar to \"D. antarctica\" but is found in more sheltered coasts.  \"D. willana\" has smaller blades than \"D. antarctica\" and is usually found lower on the shoreline because its tolerance of wave action is not as great as \"D. antarctica\" (Bradstock, 1989).  \"D. willana\" has no common name in New Zealand, however is usually mistaken for bull kelp, \"Durvillaea antarctica\".  \"D. willana\" stipes are thick and long.  Off the stipe there are side branches of small fronds, this gives the algae a tree like form.  The fronds are not honeycombed like \"D. antarctica\".  The holdfast becomes large and spreads like a plate on rocky substrates (Bradstock, 1989). \n\nDuncan Brinsmead (born January 26, 1960 in Edmonton, Alberta) is a Canadian software programmer, best known for patents on the simulation of natural environments in 3D computer graphics (CGI).  He created the Maya \"Paint Effects\" for digitally painting instances like plants or hair in a virtual 3D environment.  In 2008, together with Jos Stam, Julia Pakalns and Martin Werner he received an Academy Award for Technical Achievement for the design and implementation of the Maya \"Fluid Effects\" system.  Fluid Effects are based on the simulation of fluid mechanics in software and used for simulating natural phenomena such as fog, steam or smoke. \n\nThe poem begins with the description of the tree.  The poet says that the creeper has wound itself round the rugged trunk of the Casuarina Tree, like a huge Python.  The creeper has left deep marks on the trunk of the tree.  The tree is so strong that it bears the tight hold of the creeper.  The tree is described as being gallant, and possibly brave, as very few trees could survive in the strangle-hold of this creeper.  The poet then goes on to describe the life that thrives amidst every facet of the tree.  The tree is metaphorical said as a giant due to its huge size, strength and boldness.  The Casuarina Tree is covered with creeper which bears red crimson flowers which appear as though the tree is wearing a colorful scarf.  Often at night, the garden echoes and it seems to be jubilant and the song (of a nightingale) has no end; it continues till dawn.  At dawn when the poet opens her window she is delighted to see the Casuarina Tree.  Mostly in winters a gray baboon is seen sitting on the crest of the tree seeing the sunrise with her younger ones leaping and playing in the tree's boughs.  The shadow of the tree appears to fall on the huge water tank.  Toru Dutt says that it is not because of the majestic appearance of the Casuarina Tree that it is dear to her heart and soul, but also that she along with her siblings spent happy moments under it.  Toru Dutt has brought out the theme of nature as something that shares feeling with humans, that lightens the burden on the heart.  The poet continues with a description of how strong the image of the tree is, even when in lands far away.  Even in France and Italy (where the poet studied), she can hear the tree's lament.  The poet wishes to consecrate the tree's memory and importance for the sake of those who are now dead - and looks ahead to her own death, hoping that the tree be spared obscurity (or that no-one will remember it).  She immortalizes the tree through this poem like how Wordsworth sanctified the Yew trees of Borrowdale.  She says \"May love defend thee from Oblivion's curse'\"- by which she means that she is glad that her love for the Casuarina will protect it from the curse of being forgotten. \n\n",

        "context": "George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel ( ; born Georg Friedrich H\u00e4ndel ] ; 23 February 1685 (O.S.) [(N.S.) 5 March] \u2013 14 April 1759) was a German, later British, baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos. Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727.  He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition. \n\nTomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671 \u2013 17 January 1751) was an Italian Baroque composer.  While famous in his day as an opera composer, he is mainly remembered today for his instrumental music, such as the concerti. \n\nLuigi Rossi (c. 1597 \u2013 20 February 1653) was an Italian Baroque composer.  Rossi was born in Torremaggiore, a small town near Foggia, in the ancient kingdom of Naples and at an early age he went to Naples.  There he studied music with the Franco-Flemish composer Jean de Macque who was organist of the Santa Casa dell\u2019Annunziata and \"maestro di cappella\" to the Spanish viceroy.  Rossi later entered the service of the Caetani, dukes of Traetta. \n\nGiuseppe Domenico Scarlatti (Naples, 26 October 1685 Madrid, 23 July 1757) was an Italian composer who spent much of his life in the service of the Portuguese and Spanish royal families.  He is classified primarily as a Baroque composer chronologically, although his music was influential in the development of the Classical style and he was one of the few Baroque composers to transition into the classical period.  Like his renowned father Alessandro Scarlatti, he composed in a variety of musical forms, although today he is known mainly for his 555 keyboard sonatas. \n\nL'estro armonico (the harmonic inspiration), Antonio Vivaldi's Op. \u00a03, is a set of 12 concertos for stringed instruments, first published in Amsterdam in 1711.  Vivaldi's Twelve Trio Sonatas, Op. 1, and Twelve Violin Sonatas, Op. 2, only contained sonatas, thus \"L'estro armonico\" was his first collection of concertos appearing in print.  It was also the first time he chose a foreign publisher, Estienne Roger, instead of an Italian.  Each concerto was printed in eight parts: four violins, two violas, cello and continuo.  The continuo part was printed as a figured bass for violone and harpsichord. \n\nAntonio Lucio Vivaldi (] ; 4 March 1678\u00a0\u2013 28 July 1741) was an Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and cleric.  Born in Venice, he is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe.  He composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as \"The Four Seasons\". \n\nLorenzo Ratti (ca. 1589\u20131630) was an Italian baroque composer.  He was the predecessor of Carissimi at the Collegium Germanicum.  He composed six Gospel Dialogues for the oratory.  He was a teacher of Benevoli. \n\nFrancesco Scarlatti (5 December 1666 \u2013 c. 1741) was an Italian Baroque composer and musician and the younger brother of the better known Alessandro Scarlatti. \n\nJean Baptiste Senaill\u00e9 (23 November 1687 in Paris \u2013 15 October 1730 idem) was a French born Baroque composer and violin virtuoso.  His father was a member of Les Vingt-quatre Violons du Roi.  Senaill\u00e9 studied under Jean-Baptiste Anet, Giovanni Antonio Piani and in Italy under Tomaso Antonio Vitali and imported Italian musical techniques and pieces into the French court.  He wrote around 50 violin sonatas.  He is most well known for a fast 2/4 movement from one of these sonatas, \"Allegro Spiritoso\", which has had versions published transcribed for a wide variety of instruments, from violoncello to bassoon to euphonium. \n\nAntonio Lotti (5 January 1667 \u2013 5 January 1740) was an Italian Baroque composer. \n\n",

It was first given to Butch Van Artsdalen, and is passed on from generation to generation, by consensus.  Other holders of the title have included sometime actor Gerry Lopez and bodyboarding legend Mike Stewart. \n\nLake surfing is surfing on any lake with sufficient surface area for wind to produce suitable waves.  As with ocean surfing, ideal wave conditions are when the wind switches offshore.  However, when this occurs over a lake the waves generated by previous onshore wind subside relatively quickly.  This means lake surfers have a shorter window of opportunity to surf ideal waves.  Lake surfers are often out during and experiencing the same storm that creates the waves whereas ocean surfers are more often surfing on swell produced by storms hundreds of miles away and that may have taken days to reach shore.  In addition to making it more difficult to manage surfboards, high winds can make the face of a wave and water surface rough.  Increased wave frequency due to shorter fetch results in less rest between waves and sets of waves.  This can make it necessary to paddle out through waves because there may not be a long enough pause between sets to paddle out between them.  Though not significant enough to necessitate surfboard design changes, the reduced buoyancy of fresh water results in increased drag when paddling.  Lake surfers enjoy water that is fresh (\"sweet\" as opposed to salty) and do not have to worry about the dangers from marine life (e.g. sharks, jellyfish, etc.) that ocean surfers may have to contend with. \n\nBrylan Van Artsdalen (born August 14, 1984) is an American mixed martial artist currently competing in the Featherweight division.  A professional competitor since 2010, Van Artsdalen has formerly competed for Bellator and CES MMA. \n\nSkimboarding (or skimming) is a boardsport in which a \"skimboard\" (much like a surfboard but smaller and without fins) is used to glide across the water's surface to meet an incoming breaking wave, and ride it back to shore.  Wave-riding skimboarders perform a variety of surface and air maneuvers, at various stages of their ride, out to, and back with, the wave.  Some of these are known as \"wraps,\" \"big spins,\" \"360 shove-its\" and \"180s.\"  Unlike surfing, skimboarding begins on the beach by dropping the board onto the thin wash of previous waves.  Skimboarders use their momentum to skim out to breaking waves, which they then catch back into shore in a manner similar to surfing.  Another aspect of skimboarding is \"flatland,\" which involves performing tricks derived from skateboarding such as ollies and shove-its on the wash of waves without catching shore breaks. Skimboarding originated in Southern California when Laguna Beach lifeguards wanted to surf the local shore breaks that was too fast and shallow for surfboards.  Skimboarding has developed since then to ride waves much like surfing, performing aerial maneuvers and pulling into the barrel of the wave.  Even further, professionals have started getting towed by waverunners into much larger waves.  Professional Skimboarder, Brad Domke, displayed the new technique in this video. \n\nDonald West VanArtsdalen (sometimes listed as Van Artsdalen; born October 21, 1919) is a Senior United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \n\nCharles M. Van Artsdalen (January 31, 1941 \u2013 July 18, 1979) was a legendary surfer.  He moved to La Jolla, California, from his birthplace of Norfolk, Virginia, at age 14.  Van Artsdalen is best known as a pioneer of surfing 25-foot waves at such North Shore locations as Waimea Bay and Sunset Beach; and tube riding in Hawaii during the early 1960-1970s.  A member of the Duke Kahanamoku Surf Team, he appeared in several surf movies and remained a fixture of the international surfing community until his death from alcohol-related illness in 1979. \n\nTow-in surfing is a surfing technique which uses artificial assistance to allow the surfer to catch faster moving waves than was traditionally possible when paddling by hand.  Tow-in surfing was invented by surfers who wanted to catch big waves and break the 30 foot barrier.  It has been one of the biggest breakthroughs in surfing history. \n\nWaimea Bay is located in Haleiwa on the North Shore of O'ahu in the Hawaiian Islands at the mouth of the Waimea River.  Waimea Valley extends behind Waimea Bay.  \"Waimea\" means \"reddish water\" in Hawaiian. \n\nWaimea Canyon, also known as the \"Grand Canyon of the Pacific\", is a large canyon, approximately ten miles (16\u00a0km) long and up to 3,000 feet (900 m) deep, located on the western side of Kaua\u02bb i in the Hawaiian Islands of the United States.  Waimea is Hawaiian for \"reddish water\", a reference to the erosion of the canyon's red soil.  The canyon was formed by a deep incision of the Waimea River arising from the extreme rainfall on the island's central peak, Mount Wai\u02bb ale\u02bb ale, among the wettest places on earth. \n\nWaimea is a common name in Hawaii and New Zealand.  In Hawaiian, it means reddish water, but in Maori it has no meaning.  It may refer to: \n\n",

After the invasion of China, all Arisaka production was required for use of the Imperial Army, so under the terms of the Anti-Comintern Pact, the Imperial Navy contracted with Italy for this weapon in 1937.  The Type I is based on the Type 38 rifle and utilizes a Carcano action, but retains the Arisaka/Mauser type 5-round box magazine.  The Type I was utilized primarily by Japanese Imperial Naval Forces.  It is chambered for the 6.5 x 50 mm cartridge.  Approximately 80,000 Type I rifles were produced in 1938 and 1939, 40,000 manufactured by Beretta and an equal number by Italian government arsenals; the final shipment to Japan left Venice by submarine in 1941. \n\nEugene Cross Park is a rugby and cricket ground in Ebbw Vale, Wales.  In November 1919 the Ebbw Vale Welfare Association was formed and bought the \"Bridgend Field\".  The 6 acre of land became known as the Welfare Ground, and in 1973 its name was changed to its present title in honour of Sir Eugene Cross, the influential and long-standing Chairman of the Welfare Trustees.  The ground has terraces, a stand which was bought due to a fire which burnt the previous stands and a clubhouse which boasts a pub, a club shop open at match days and award-winning hospitality packages.

It was a copy of the American M1 Garand but with an integral 10-round magazine and chambered for the Japanese 7.7\u00d758mm Arisaka cartridge.  Where the Garand used an en-bloc clip, the Type 4's integral magazine was charged with two 5-round stripper clips and the rifle also used Japanese-style tangent sights.  The Type 4 had been developed alongside several other experimental semi-automatic rifles.  However, none of the rifles entered into service before the end of World War II, with only 250 being made, and many others were never assembled.  There were several problems with jamming and feed systems, which also delayed its testing. \n\nEugene Brody, (Eugene Bloor Brody), (1921\u20132010) was an American psychiatrist.

This family includes a standard Assault rifle variant, a compact carbine variant and this particular light support weapon/Squad automatic weapon variant.  The longer, heavier barrel and 80-round drum magazine of the QBB-95 allow sustained firing, however the standard 30-round box magazine is also compatible. \n\nEdward Eugene \"Eugene\" or \"Goober\" Cox (April 3, 1880 \u2013 December 24, 1952) served as a U.S. Representative from Georgia for nearly twenty-eight years.

A failed attempt to create another such committee would turn out to have far-reaching consequences: in 1941, with American entry into World War II seeming inevitable, Cox proposed an investigative committee, similar to the Civil War-era Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, to deal with matters of national defense.  When Roosevelt learned of Cox's intentions, he pre-empted them by agreeing to a similar proposal from Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman; the Truman Committee would come to be seen as a significant asset to the war effort, and its chairman - a little-known \"backbencher\" at the time of its founding - would become Roosevelt's Vice President and, after his death in 1945, President of the United States. \n\nChasing Daylight is a biography and a common-sense guidebook on how to embrace death without fear or sadness by Eugene O'Kelly, who is the Ex-Chairman and former CEO of KPMG, one of the largest U.S. accounting firms.  The biography won, among other awards, the International Business Book Award from the Financial Times.  The author, Eugene O\u2019Kelly, was the CEO and Chairman of KPMG until being diagnosed with a terminal brain tumor at 53.  He quit his job to settle his accounts with friends and family and write his book to convey how he lived the last 100 days of his life and make it the best time of his life. \n\n",

Rahman, Boyle's previous collaborator on \"Slumdog Millionaire\".  The score, centred on guitar, was recorded mainly in London and was completed in three weeks.  The soundtrack was released digitally on 2 November and physically on 22 November, by Interscope Records.  The score is briefly orchestral and the song's main theme, \"If I Rise\" features Rahman playing the Harpejji. \n\nThe Academy Award for Best Film Editing is one of the annual awards of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS).  Nominations for this award are closely correlated with the Academy Award for Best Picture.  For 33 consecutive years, 1981 to 2013, every Best Picture winner had also been nominated for the Film Editing Oscar, and about two thirds of the Best Picture winners have also won for Film Editing.  Only the principal, \"above the line\" editor(s) as listed in the film's credits are named on the award; additional editors, supervising editors, etc. are not currently eligible.  The nominations for this Academy Award are determined by a ballot of the voting members of the Editing Branch of the Academy; there were 220 members of the Editing Branch in 2012.  The members may vote for up to five of the eligible films in the order of their preference; the five films with the largest vote totals are selected as nominees.  The Academy Award itself is selected from the nominated films by a subsequent ballot of all active and life members of the Academy.  This process is essentially the reverse of that of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA); nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Editing are done by a general ballot of Academy voters, and the winner is selected by members of the editing chapter. \n\nJames Edward Franco (born April 19, 1978) is an American actor, director, screenwriter, and producer.

This list details the performances of Polish actors, actresses, and films that have either been submitted or nominated for, or have won, an Academy Award.  This list is current as of the 80th Academy Awards ceremony held on February 24, 2008.  There were 12 Academy Awards given to Polish filmmakers or their work (see Foreign Film category), including two Honorary Academy Awards and a Technical Achievement Award.  The category of Cinematography has the strongest presence of Polish filmmakers, with two wins (both by Janusz Kami\u0144ski) and five other nominations (including two noms for Kami\u0144ski).  As of that, the cinematographer Janusz Kami\u0144ski is the most Oscar-awarded Polish filmmaker.  The second most-awarded Pole was designer Anton Grot, who won one Academy Award and was nominated to the Oscars five times more.  The director Roman Polanski won an Oscar and was nominated four more times (additionally, \"Knife in the Water\", film directed and written by him was also nominated).  The composer Bronislau Kaper was awarded an Oscar and was nominated three times more. \n\nPeople Like Us: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack to Alex Kurtzman's 2012 film of the same name.

On August 26, 2003 a Beech 1900D crashed into water 100 yards offshore from Yarmouth, Massachusetts, United States shortly after taking off from Barnstable Municipal Airport in Yarmouth.  Captain Scott Knabe and First Officer Steven Dean died.  The plane was bound for Albany, New York, U.S. \n\nGameel Al-Batouti (Arabic: \u062c\u0645\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0637\u0648\u0637\u064a\u200e \u200e ; also rendered \"Gamil El Batouti\" or \"El Batouty\" in U.S. official reports; 2 February 1940 \u2013 31 October 1999) was a pilot for EgyptAir and a former officer for the Egyptian Air Force.  On 31 October 1999, all 217 people aboard EgyptAir Flight 990 were killed when it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean about 60 mi southeast of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts.  The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the official probable cause of the crash was a series of control inputs made by Al-Batouti, who was in the position of relief first officer in command at the time of the crash. \n\nThe LeRoy W. Homer Jr.  Foundation is a national 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in memory of First Officer LeRoy W. Homer Jr..  LeRoy Homer was the co-pilot of United Airlines Flight #93, which crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001.  The flight recordings revealed that Dahl and Homer survived the initial attack and were still alive after the hijackers took over the plane.  It is believed that Dahl and Homer took actions to interfere with the hijackers, including disengaging the autopilot just before the hijackers took over in order to prevent them from setting the plane's target coordinates for Washington, D.C., and switching the output of the pilots' microphones from the cabin address speakers to the radio transmitter so that Jarrah's attempts to communicate with the passengers would instead be heard by air traffic controllers.  After learning of the earlier crashes at the thumb|right|World Trade CenterMelodie and the Pentagon, the crew and passengers attempted to foil the hijacking and reclaim the aircraft.  Meanwhile, the hijackers were not able to disengage the autopilot.  Dahl continued to struggle in the cockpit, refusing to allow a hijacker to deactivate the autopilot so he could fly the plane manually.  The hijackers were heard to say \"Inform them, and tell him to talk to the pilot; bring back the pilot\", possibly referring toLaurel Homer (CVR transcripts).  However, the uprising of crew and passengers took place and during the attempt the plane crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania2002.  The crash killed everyone on board.  Before the plane went down, she says, he had regained consciousness and was part of the final attack that forced the plane to abort its intended target, which was somewhere in Washington, D.C., and crash.ref>]] \n\nGaruda Indonesia Flight 200 (GA200/GIA 200) was a scheduled domestic passenger flight of a Boeing 737-400 operated by Garuda Indonesia between Jakarta and Yogyakarta, Indonesia.  The aircraft overran the runway, crashed into a rice field and burst into flames while landing at Adisucipto International Airport on 7 March 2007.  Twenty passengers and one crew member were killed.  Both the captain and the first officer survived. \n\nEgyptAir Flight 990 (MS990/MSR990) was a regularly scheduled flight from Los Angeles International Airport, United States, to Cairo International Airport, Egypt, with a stop at John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City.  On October 31, 1999, the Boeing 767 operating the route crashed into the Atlantic Ocean about 60 mi south of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, killing all 217 people on board.

On March 23, 2009, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11F (N526FE) operating the flight crashed at 6:48 am JST (21:48 UTC, March 22), while attempting a landing on Runway 34L in gusty wind conditions.  The aircraft became destabilized at flare and touchdown resulting in an unrecovered \"bounced\" landing with structural failure of the landing gear and airframe, and came to rest off the runway, inverted, and burning fiercely.  The captain and first officer, the jet's only occupants, were both killed. \n\nThird officer is a lesser used civil aviation rank.  It was primarily used by Pan American World Airways, particularly on its \"Clippers\" during the infancy of extended range airline routes.  The third officer served as a relief pilot and aircrew member and could move between pilot, co-pilot, radio officer, and flight engineer positions to provide a rest period for the primary crews (\"Flying The World In Clipper Ships\").  Third officers in modern civil aviation are often not formally titled as such.  Rather, these relief pilots take on a junior first officer rank or in some cases a second officer rank. \n\nAurelio Valle is an American singer, guitarist, composer and visual art residing in New York, New York born in Chicago, Illinois and raised in Kingsville, Texas.

Originally it was a dirt surface all-purpose athletic field in exactly its current configuration, built within a clay pit, a fitting mined-out home for the Orediggers.  Its first athletic contest, held on May 20, 1893, was the first annual Colorado Inter-Collegiate Athletic Association Field Day, featuring many athletic contests between the University of Colorado, Colorado A&M, Colorado School of Mines, and the University of Denver, in which Mines claimed the most medals.  Its first football game took place on October 7, 1893, a 6-0 Mines victory over the University of Denver.  It has been home to the football Orediggers through all but the first five seasons of their existence (their previous home were the now-destroyed grounds at the southeast corner of 19th and Illinois streets in Golden), and has been renovated several times throughout its existence.  The field was originally called Athletic Park, renamed Brooks Field after Mines trustee and benefactor Ralph D. Brooks in 1922, and renamed Campbell Field after 1939 undefeated team member and benefactor Harry D. Campbell in 2010.

        "context": "VELUX is a Danish manufacturing company that specializes in roof windows and skylights.  The first VELUX roof window was installed in a Danish school over 75 years ago by the founder of the company, Villum Kann Rasmussen.  The company has been steadily growing since, entering the German market in 1952 in a partnership with Ernst G\u00fcnter Albers and then later between the sons, Lars Kann-Rasmussen and Peter Albers \n\nThe Ford flathead V8 (often called simply the Ford flathead, flathead Ford, or flatty when the context is implicit, such as in hot-rodding) is a V8 engine of the valve-in-block type designed by the Ford Motor Company and built by Ford and various licensees.  During the engine's first decade of production, when overhead-valve engines were rare, it was usually known simply as the Ford V\u20118, and the first car model in which it was installed, the Model 18, was (and still is) often called simply the \"Ford V\u20118\", after its new engine.  Although the V8 configuration was not new when the Ford V8 was introduced in 1932, the latter was a market first in the respect that it made an 8-cylinder affordable and a V engine affordable to the emerging mass market consumer for the first time.  It was the first independently designed and built V8 engine produced by Ford for mass production, and it ranks as one of the company's most important developments.  A fascination with ever-more-powerful engines was perhaps the most salient aspect of the American car and truck market for a half century, from 1923 until 1973.  The Ford flathead V8 was perfectly in tune with the cultural moment of its introduction, leading the way into a future of which the Ford company was a principal architect.  Thus it became a phenomenal success.  The engine design, with various changes but no major ones, was installed in Ford passenger cars and trucks until 1953, making the engine's 21-year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19-year run of the Ford Model T engine for that market.  The engine was on Ward's list of the 10 best engines of the 20th century.  It was a staple of hot rodders in the 1950s, and it remains famous in the classic car hobbies even today, despite the huge variety of other popular V8s that followed. \n\nVeti-gel is a veterinary product, a plant-derived injectable gel that is claimed to quickly stop traumatic bleeding on external and internal wounds.

It is manufactured by Suneris Inc, an American biotechnology company, which is also exploring human products derived from its technology, slated to launch as early as 2016.  The company plans on releasing a product for the military and the emergency medicine market first, followed by a product for the human surgical market when FDA approval is granted. \n\n\"Ver\u00e3o Vermelho\" is a song by Santana which came off the album \"Festival\".  Carlos Santana pays homage to Brazilian singer, Elis Regina.  This song features some excellent acoustic guitar with The Waters Family backing vocalists (Julia, Oren, and Maxine Willard Waters) singing the meaningless words, \u201dBadadup, badadup, badadup, ba pa pa ba pa pa.\u201d  It is carried along by a marching drum beat and maracas. Santana plays a flamenco guitar solo during the intro and at the conclusion.  This is a first for him.  The flamenco guitar solo during the coda is accompanied by a keyboard flourish by Tom Coster. \n\nWalton and Willett Stone Store, also known as Cahill's Fish Market, is a historic commercial building located at Oswego in Oswego County, New York.

The breed was previously considered endangered, but as of 2003, more than 5000 registered Roves are on French farms.  The goat was originally bred for meat, but because the current French market for goat meat is poor, farmers have begun to use the Rove for dairying, instead. \n\nFriendship Hall is a historic home located at East New Market, Dorchester County, Maryland.  It is a Georgian-style brick dwelling.  It consists of a large five-bay, two-story main block built about 1790; a two-bay one-story passage; and a 1\u00a0\u2044 -story kitchen wing.  Also on the property is a tall frame smokehouse with board-and-batten siding and a steep gable roof.  It is associated with the locally prominent Sulivane family, who first came to Maryland in 1695. \n\nHey Pa!  There's a Goat on the Roof was a children's board game issued by Parker Brothers in 1966. \n\nPashmina is a fine type of cashmere wool.  The textiles made from it were first woven in Kashmir, India.  The name comes from Persian: \u067e\u0634\u0645\u06cc\u0646\u0647\u200e \u200e / \"pa\u0161mina\", meaning \"made from wool\" and literally translates to \"Soft Gold\" in Kashmiri.  Pashmina shawls are known to pass entirely through a wearable ring with diameter of about half an inch.  Pashmina came to be known as 'cashmere' in the West because Europeans first encountered this fibre in Kashmir.  The wool comes from four distinct breeds of the Cashmere goat; namely the Changthangi or Kashmir Pashmina goat from the Changthang plateau in Kashmir region, the Malra from Kargil area in Kashmir region, the Chegu from Himachal Pradesh in northern India and Pakistan, and Chyangara or Nepalese Pashmina goat from Nepal.  These shawls are hand spun, and woven in Kashmir and Nepal, and made from fine cashmere fibre. \n\n",

Leavy was, in his twenty-year NFL officiating career, assigned to fifteen playoff games, including two Super Bowls.  He was selected as a back judge on the Super Bowl XXXIV officiating crew in 2000 and most recently headed up the Super Bowl XL officiating crew as referee in 2006. \n\nSuper Bowl XXXVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Oakland Raiders and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2002 season.  The Buccaneers defeated the Raiders by the score of 48\u201321, tied with Super Bowl XXXV for the seventh largest Super Bowl margin of victory, and winning their first ever Super Bowl.  The game, played on January 26, 2003 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California, was the sixth Super Bowl to be held a week after the conference championship games (XVII, XXV, XXVIII, XXXIV, and XXXVI).  It was also the last Super Bowl played in the month of January.  Super Bowl XXXVI was the first to be played in February, due to the NFL postponing games for a week after the September 11 attacks.  Starting with Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, the Super Bowl has been permanently played in February.  This was the last Super Bowl until Super Bowl 50 to take place in California. \n\nTodd Franklin Collins (born May 27, 1970) is a former National Football League linebacker.  He started for the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXI, and Super Bowl XXXIV for the Rams. \n\nSuper Bowl XXXIV was an American football game between the National Football Conference (NFC) champion St. Louis Rams (now the Los Angeles Rams) and the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Tennessee Titans to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 1999 season.  The Rams defeated the Titans by the score of 23\u201316, capturing their first Super Bowl win and first NFL championship since 1951.  The game, played on January 30, 2000 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, was the fourth Super Bowl to be held a week after the conference championship games (the previous time this happened was Super Bowl XXVIII, and coincidentally that game was also played on January 30 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta). \n\nRichard Scott Proehl (born March 7, 1968) is a former American football wide receiver in the National Football League.  Proehl played 17 seasons with the Phoenix/Arizona Cardinals, Seattle Seahawks, Chicago Bears, St. Louis Rams, Carolina Panthers, and Indianapolis Colts.  He played in four Super Bowls and won two: Super Bowl XXXIV with the Rams and Super Bowl XLI with the Colts. \n\nThomas E. \"Ted\" Plumb (born August 20, 1939) is a former American football player & coach.  His playing career ended after a neck injury in training camp as he looked like a promising young receiver for the Buffalo Bills out of Baylor University.  Although his playing career was cut short by injury, it helped lift him into what became a long and exciting coaching career in: High School, College, & onto the NFL.  Ted Plumb's NFL coaching career is special and unique as he was a coach for two of the most legendary Super Bowl champions in the history of the NFL; The Super Bowl XX Champion 1985 Bears, and the Super Bowl XXXIV Champion 2000 St. Louis Rams.  Teddy served as the Wide Receivers Coach with the \"Monsters of the Midway\" Chicago Bears, and he served as the Director of Pro Scouting for the \"Greatest Show on Turf\" 2000 St. Louis Rams (according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch April 19, 2000).  Plumb retired after that 2000 season to his home in Alba, Texas. \n\nThis is a list of seasons completed by the Tennessee Titans, an American football franchise of the National Football League (NFL).  The list documents the season-by-season records of the Titans' franchise from 1960 to the present, including postseason records and league awards for individual players or head coaches.  The Titans were originally known as the Houston Oilers and were a part of the inaugural season of the American Football League (AFL) in 1960.  In 1997, the franchise moved to Tennessee, playing in Memphis temporarily until settling in Nashville.  The team was rebranded as the Titans following the 1998 season.  The Titans have yet to win a Super Bowl, falling short in their only appearance in Super Bowl XXXIV, although the team does have two championships from its early years in the AFL.  During their tenure in Tennessee they have defeated all 31 other franchises at least once, enjoying a perfect record against the Detroit Lions (5-0). \n\nJeffrey William \"Jeff\" Robinson (born February 20, 1970) is a former professional football player, last as long snapper for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League.  He was selected in the fourth round of the 1993 NFL Draft by the Denver Broncos, the 98th overall pick.  Robinson later played for the St. Louis Rams and Dallas Cowboys; he earned a Super Bowl ring with the Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV.  Robinson played college football at Idaho, where he was a four-year starter at defensive end. \n\nSuper Bowl LIII, the 53rd Super Bowl and the 49th modern-era National Football League (NFL) championship game, will decide the league champion for the 2018 NFL season.  The game will be played on Sunday, February 3, 2019, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia.  This will be the third Super Bowl in Atlanta, having previously hosted Super Bowl XXVIII in 1994 and Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000.  The game is set to be televised nationally by CBS. \n\nDonald Andr\u00e9 \"Dr\u00e9\" Bly (born May 22, 1977) is a retired American college and professional football player who was a cornerback in the National Football League (NFL) for eleven seasons.  He played college football for the University of North Carolina (UNC), and earned All-American honors twice.  Bly was drafted by the St. Louis Rams in the second round of the 1999 NFL Draft, and spent four seasons with the Rams, earning a Super Bowl ring with them in Super Bowl XXXIV over the Tennessee Titans.

        "context": "The Interstate Highways in Illinois are all segments of the Interstate Highway System that are owned and maintained by the U.S. state of Illinois.  The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) is responsible for maintaining these highways in Illinois.  The Interstate Highway System in Illinois consists of 13 primary highways and 11 auxiliary highways which cover 2,248.93 mi .  The Interstate Highway with the longest section in Illinois is Interstate 57 at 358.57 mi ; the shortest is Interstate 41 at 0.90 mi . \n\nThe Interstate Highways in the state of Florida are owned and maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT).  There are four primary interstate highways and eight auxiliary highways, with a ninth proposed, totaling 1497.58 mi interstate miles in Florida.  The longest interstate is I-75, extending 470.678 mi , and the shortest is I-395, extending just 1.292 mi . \n\nThe following is a list of Interstate Highways in Maryland.  There are currently 16 Interstate Highways that exist entirely or partially in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Six of these are primary Interstates while ten are auxiliary Interstates related to one of the primary Interstates.  The longest primary Interstate in Maryland is Interstate 95 (commonly abbreviated I-95) at 110.01 mi .  The shortest primary Interstate in Maryland is I-81 at 12.08 mi .  I-97 is the shortest primary Interstate at 17.62 mi and the shortest intrastate Interstate.  I-97 is also the only primary Interstate to be located entirely within one county and to not connect with any other primary Interstate.  The longest auxiliary Interstate in Maryland is I-695 at 51.48 mi .  The shortest auxiliary Interstate in Maryland is I-295 at 0.80 mi .  All Interstates are maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration except for all of I-395, all of I-895, a small part of I-695, I-95 within and north of Baltimore, and I-83 within Baltimore.  Maryland has one unsigned Interstate, I-595; that highway is marked as U.S. Route 50 and US 301, which are concurrent with I-595 for its entire length.  Maryland has one former Interstate, I-170, which is shaded in dark gray in the list. \n\nThe auxiliary Interstate Highways (also called three-digit Interstate Highways) are a supplemental subset of the freeways within the Interstate Highway System of the United States.  Similar to the mainline Interstate Highways, these highways also meet all Interstate Highway Standards (with rare exceptions), they receive the same percentage of federal funding (90%), and they comply with other federal standards. \n\nInterstate 85 (I-85) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from Montgomery, Alabama to Petersburg, Virginia.  In Virginia, the Interstate Highway runs 68.64 mi from the North Carolina state line near Bracey north to I-95 in Petersburg.  I-85 passes through the eastern part of Southside Virginia, where it parallels U.S. Route 1 (US 1) from Petersburg, where the highway runs concurrently with US 460, to south of South Hill, where the highway intersects Southside's major east\u2013west highway, US 58.  The Interstate Highway is the primary connection between the Richmond\u2013Petersburg metropolitan area and the Research Triangle and other major metropolitan areas of North Carolina.  Like all mainline Interstate Highways, I-85 is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length in Virginia. \n\nThe Interstate Highways in Texas are all owned and maintained by the U.S. state of Texas.  The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is the agency responsible for the day-to-day maintenance and operations of the Interstate Highways in Texas.  The Interstate Highway System in Texas covers 3239.7 mi and consists of twelve primary routes, seven auxiliary routes and Interstate 35 (I-35) which is split into two branches, I-35E and I-35W, that provide access to both Fort Worth and Dallas.  The longest segment of Interstate Highway in Texas is I-10 at 878.6 mi ; the shortest is I-110 at 0.9 mi . \n\nThere are 32\u00a0Interstate Highways\u20149\u00a0main routes and 23\u00a0auxiliary routes\u2014that exist entirely or partially in the U.S. state of New York.  In New York, Interstate Highways are mostly maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), with some exceptions.  Unlike in some other states, Interstate Highways in New York are not directly referenced by NYSDOT with their number; instead, the letter \"I\" is suffixed to the number of the route on reference markers and in internal documents.  On the surface, there appears to be numerical duplication between several Interstate Highways and state routes\u2014such as I-86 (I-86) and NY\u00a086\u2014but the \"I\" suffix that is appended to Interstate Highway numbers allows the Interstate Highway and state route to co-exist (\"86I\" versus \"86\", respectively). \n\nCoinciding with the designation of several routes in the Interstate Highway System through Utah, the Utah State Legislature made several changes to the Utah State Route system.  The bulk of these changes were not visible to the public, but were to unsigned legislative designations only.  The primary effect was designating route numbers 1 through 5 for future corridors of the Interstate Highways in Utah.  There were also changes made to a few unsigned highways serving state parks and institutions.  Several other routes were truncated or re-assigned or split into multiple designations to allow the Interstate Highway corridors to have a single route number assigned.  As very little of the Interstate Highway System had been constructed in Utah by 1962, these changes were primarily to support future construction.  There were a number of cases where the legislative change enacted in 1962 would not be built and signed until years later.  Few of the changes made in 1962 are still valid today.  As construction of the Interstate Highway system proceeded, additional changes were made.  The legislature made a larger change in route designations in 1977, eliminating unsigned legislative and concurrences in the process. \n\nInterstate 81 (I-81) is an 855 mi highway.  In the U.S. state of Virginia, I-81 runs for 324.92 mi , making the portion in Virginia longer than any other state's portion.  It is also the longest Interstate highway within the borders of Virginia.  It stretches from the Tennessee state line near Bristol to the West Virginia state line near Winchester. \n\nInterstate 40 (I-40) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from Barstow, California to Wilmington, North Carolina.  In North Carolina, I-40 enters the state along the Pigeon River Gorge, from Tennessee.  Crossing the entire state, it connects the cities of Asheville, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Durham and Raleigh before ending along U.S. Highway\u00a0117/North Carolina Highway\u00a0132 (US\u00a0117/NC\u00a0132) in Wilmington.  The landscapes traversed by I-40 include the Blue Ridge Mountains, foothills of western North Carolina, suburban communities, the urban core of several Piedmont cities, along with eastern North Carolina farmland.  At a total of 423.55 mi , it is the longest interstate highway in North Carolina.  There are five auxiliary Interstates in the state related to I-40, as well as one business loop which currently runs through Winston-Salem.

Despite its name, the Mexican Mafia did not originate in Mexico, and is entirely a U.S. criminal prison organization.  Sure\u00f1os, including MS-13 is a Mexican gange.  and Florencia 13, use the number 13 to show allegiance to the Mexican Mafia.  M is the 13th letter of the alphabet.  Law enforcement officials report that La eMe is the most powerful gang within the California prison system.  Government officials state that there are currently 155\u2013300 official members of the Mexican Mafia with around 990 associates who assist La eMe in carrying out its illegal activities in the hopes of becoming full members. \n\nThe Sopranos is an American crime drama television series created by David Chase.  The story revolves around the fictional character, New Jersey-based Italian American mobster Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini).  The series portrays the difficulties he faces as he tries to balance the conflicting requirements of his home life and his criminal organization.  These are often highlighted during his therapy sessions with psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco).  The series features Tony's family members, mafia colleagues and rivals, in prominent roles and story arcs, most notably his wife Carmela (Edie Falco) and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli). \n\nOperation Power Outage was a law enforcement sting operation targeted at arresting and indicting members of the Armenian American criminal group Armenian Power operating in the United States.  The group is accused of racketeering offenses, bank fraud schemes, kidnappings, and drug trafficking.  Armenian Power (also known as AP-13) which originated 20 years ago in East Hollywood and has over 200 members, has developed from a street gang into an international criminal organization. \n\nArmenian Power, also known as West Side AP XIII, AP, the Armenian Mob, or Armenian Mafia is an Armenian American criminal organization and street gang located in Los Angeles County, California.  They are involved in drug trafficking, murder, assault, fraud, identity theft, illegal gambling, kidnapping, racketeering, robbery and extortion.  They are believed to have over 150 documented members and hundreds of associates, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office. \n\nThe National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit institution honoring exceptional U.S. athletes of Italian descent.  In 1977 George Randazzo created the Italian American Boxing Hall of Fame.  This was as a means for raising money for local Catholic youth programs.  After a successful year and dinner honoring 23 former Italian American boxing champions, Randazzo created the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame.  The original location was in Elmwood Park, Illinois.  The first induction ceremony honored Lou Ambers, Eddie Arcaro, Charley Trippi, Gino Marchetti, Dom DiMaggio, Joe DiMaggio, and Vince Lombardi.  Since its founding in 1978, more than 230 Italian Americans have been inducted into this hall of fame. \n\nJoseph \"Baldie\" LoPiccolo (1918\u20131999) was an American criminal and member of the New York Gambino crime family and a capo under Santo Trafficante, Jr.'s criminal organization.  His specialty was narcotics trafficking. \n\nThe Barrow Gang was an American criminal organization active between 1932 and 1934.  They were well known outlaws, robbers, and criminals who as a gang traveled the Central United States during the Great Depression.  Their exploits were known nationwide.  They captured the attention of the American press and its readership during what is sometimes referred to as the \"public enemy era.\"  Though the gang was notorious for the bank robberies they committed, they preferred to rob small stores or gas stations over banks.  The gang was believed to have killed at least nine police officers, among several other murders. \n\nThe Philadelphia crime family, (pronounced ] ) also known as the Philadelphia Mafia, the Philly Mob/Mafia, the Bruno-Scarfo family, the South Philly Mob/Mafia, or the Philadelphia-South Jersey Mob/Mafia is an Italian American criminal organization based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  Formed and based in South Philadelphia, the family primarily operates in various areas and neighborhoods throughout the Philadelphia metropolitan area and Delaware Valley, Southeastern Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, especially South Jersey.  The Philadelphia family is notorious for its violence, due in particular to its succession of violent bosses and multiple mob wars. \n\nThe Los Angeles crime family is an Italian American criminal organization based in California, as part of the American Mafia (or Cosa Nostra).  Since its inception in the early 20th century, it has spread throughout Southern California.  Like most Mafia families in the United States, the L.A. crime family gained power bootlegging during the Prohibition Era.  The L.A. family reached its peak in the 1940s and early 1950s under Jack Dragna, who was on The Commission, although the L.A. family was never bigger than the New York or Chicago families.  Since his death the crime family has been on a gradual decline, with the Chicago Outfit representing them on The Commission. \n\nThe Italian American One Voice Coalition is a nationwide anti-bias organization that defends Italian American heritage and combats all forms of bigotry through information, education, legislation, and advocacy.  Its goal is to project a united front in dealing with defamation, discrimination and negative stereotyping of Italian American culture and heritage.  It is the only national Italian American organization of its type. \n\n",

He introduced Renaissance architecture to France with the assistance of Pierre Lescot, Philibert Delorme and Jean Bullant.  Though he was referred to by contemporaries as \"architecte\" and was even appointed \"architecte du roi\", he is remembered especially for his suites of engravings produced from 1549 (beginning with a suite of Triumphal arches) from his printshop in Orl\u00e9ans. \n\nJean Androuet du Cerceau (c.1585\u20131650) was a French architect, the son of Jean Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau, the outstanding Parisian architect of his generation. \n\nAndrouet du Cerceau was a family of French architects and designers active in the 16th and early 17th century. \n\nHenry III (19 September 1551\u00a0\u2013 2 August 1589; born \"Alexandre \u00c9douard de France\", Polish: \"Henryk Walezy\" , Lithuanian: \"Henrikas Valua\" ) was King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1573 to 1575 and King of France from 1574 until his death.  He was the last French monarch of the House of Valois. \n\nSalomon de Brosse (1571 \u2013 9 December 1626) was an influential early 17th-century French architect, a major influence on Fran\u00e7ois Mansart.  Salomon was born in Verneuil-en-Halatte, Oise, into a prominent Huguenot family, the grandson through his mother of the designer Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau and the son of the architect Jean de Brosse.  He was established in practice in Paris in 1598 and was promoted to court architect in 1608. \n\nJacques Androuet du Cerceau, the younger (1550 \u2013 16 September 1614), was a French architect. \n\nThe Warsaw Confederation, signed on January 28, 1573 by the Polish national assembly (\"sejm konwokacyjny\") in Warsaw, was the first European act granting religious freedoms.  It was an important development in the history of Poland and Lithuania that extended religious tolerance to nobility and free persons within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and is considered the formal beginning of religious freedom in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.  While it did not prevent all conflict based on religion, it did make the Commonwealth a much safer and more tolerant place than most of contemporaneous Europe, especially during the subsequent Thirty Years' War. \n\nPaul Androuet du Cerceau (1623\u20131710), was a French goldsmith and engraver, who was active in Paris around 1610.  According to \"Benezit\", Reynaud presumes he is the son of the architect Jean Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau, who built the Pont Neuf in Paris, but Paul is now believed to be the grandson of Jacques II Androuet du Cerceau. \n\nJean Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau (1544/47\u20131590) was a French architect who designed the Pont Neuf (1579), spanning the Seine, Paris, and became supervisor of the royal works under Henri III and Henri IV, including the Louvre.  Several \"h\u00f4tels particuliers\" are ascribed to him.  The H\u00f4tel d'Angoul\u00eame, the H\u00f4tel de Lamoignon (1584), which houses the Historical Library of the City of Paris, and the H\u00f4tel de Mayenne (rue St-Antoine in the Marais).  The H\u00f4tel de Mayenne, with rhythmically varied dormer windows set in a high slate roof, has the pediments of its piano nobile windows superposed on the frieze above. \n\nJean Baptiste Assenede (also Jan Baptist Assenede, Jean Baptiste Assenie, Jean Baptiste Asseny and nickname Lantaren was a Flemish painter from the Baroque who was active in Italy in the middle of the 17th century.  He was born in Tournai in the first half of 17th century.  He is recorded in Rome from 1646 to 1655.  Here he became a member of the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists active in Rome.  His nickname (the so-called 'bent-name') was 'Lantaren', which is Dutch for 'Lantern'.  No existing work of his hand is known today. \n\n",

        "context": "The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations.  It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001.  As the oldest and most senior branch of the U.S. military in order of precedence, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783)\u2014before the United States of America was established as a country.  After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784 to replace the disbanded Continental Army.  The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. \n\nHMT \"Empire Windrush, originally MV \"Monte Rosa, was a passenger liner and cruise ship launched in Germany in 1930.  During the 1930s, she operated as a German cruise ship under the name \"Monte Rosa\".  During World War II, she was operated by the German navy as a troopship.  She was acquired by the United Kingdom as a prize of war at the end of the war and renamed \"Empire Windrush\".  In British service, she continued to be used mainly as a troopship until March 1954, when the vessel caught fire and sank in the Mediterranean Sea with the loss of four crew. \n\nUSS \"Proton\" (AG-147/AKS-28) -- also known as USS \"LST-1078\" \u2013 was an \"LST-542\"-class tank landing ship launched by the U.S. Navy during the final months of World War II.  \"Proton\" served as a troop ship, a cargo ship and as an electronic parts supply ship for the U.S. Pacific Fleet and was decommissioned following the Korean War. \n\nTobago was a ship launched in 1790.  She came into British hands in 1793 and was probably a prize taken immediately after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in early 1793.  She traded with Tobago for several years before new owners purchased her for whaling.  She made two whaling voyages to the East Coast of Africa before her owners sold her to new owners.  She then made two voyages as a slave ship.  She is last listed in \"Lloyd's Register\" in 1806. \n\nUSS \"Electron\" (AG-146/AKS-27) -- also known as USS \"LST-1070\" \u2013 was an \"LST-542\"-class tank landing ship launched by the U.S. Navy during the final months of World War II.  \"Electron\" served as both a cargo ship and as an electronic parts supply ship for the U.S. Pacific Fleet and was decommissioned following the Korean War. \n\nUSS \"Zeilin\" (APA-3) was an Emergency Fleet Corporation Design 1029 ship launched for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) on 19 March 1921 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Newport News, Virginia as Silver State.  After operation by commercial lines for the USSB, during which the ship was renamed President Jackson, the ship was purchased and operated commercially until laid up in the late 1930s. \n\nVice-Admiral Robert Plampin (1762 \u2013 14 February 1834), was a British Royal Navy officer during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, serving in the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, but best known for his time as commander of the British colony of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic during the period when former Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was imprisoned there.  Born into a Navy family, Plampin went to sea at age 13 and fought throughout the American Revolutionary War, based principally in the Caribbean Sea.  During the French Revolutionary Wars, Plampin served in a number of ships with mixed success, once being involved in a shipwreck and twice serving ashore during sieges.  After the Peace of Amiens, Plampin took command of the ship of the line HMS\u00a0\"Powerful\" and operated successfully in the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.  In 1816, following the defeat and capture of the French Emperor, Plampin was placed in command of the squadron at the Cape of Good Hope, which also had responsibility for Saint Helena, which Plampin regularly visited and had numerous conversations with Napoleon. \n\nHMS \"Vulture\" was a 14 to 16-gun ship sloop of the \"Swan\" class, launched for the Royal Navy on 18 March 1776.  She served during both the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary War, before the Navy sold her in 1802.  \"Vulture\" is perhaps best known for being the warship to which Benedict Arnold fled on the Hudson River in 1780 after unsuccessfully trying to betray the Continental Army's fortress at West Point, New York to the British. \n\nSS \"General von Steuben was a German passenger liner and later an armed transport in the Kriegsmarine of Nazi Germany that was sunk during World War II.  She was launched as M\u00fcnchen (sometimes spelled Muenchen), renamed in 1930 as General von Steuben (after the famous German officer of the American Revolutionary War), and renamed again in 1938 as Steuben\". \n\nHMS \"Swan\" was the lead ship in the 14-gun \"Swan\" class of ship sloops, to which design 25 vessels were built in the 1760s and 1770s; she was launched on 21 November 1767.  She bore the name HMS \"Explosion\" between 1779 and 1783 whilst being used as a fireship.  She served during both the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary War before being laid up in 1801; she was sold for disposal in 1814. \n\n",

It is connected to the Norwegian mainland through a man-made causeway.  The nearest larger village on the mainland is S\u00f8vik.  To the east of the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya (between Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ya and S\u00f8vik) lies the island of Ter\u00f8ya.  The two islands are separated by the Bj\u00f8rn\u00f8ysundet.

It covers an area of some 9 square km and is the westernmost populated island in Estonia.  The surrounding waters are shallow and rocky and many ships travelling the Baltic have perished nearby.  The island of Vilsandi can be reached by boat, by truck having suitable clearance or on foot by wading from Saaremaa.  Much of the island is now part of Vilsandi National Park, which grew from a bird reserve founded in 1910.  It is a highly sensitive ecosystem due to the use of the area by many migratory birds as a breeding and nesting ground.  Hunting is absolutely prohibited.  This park is a popular tourist destination not only for local Estonians, but also people of Finland who are visiting Estonia in greater and greater numbers. \n\nGuanche mummies are the intentionally desiccated remains of members of the indigenous Guanche people of the Canary Islands.  The majority of Guanche mummies were made during the eras prior to Spanish settlement of the area in the 15th century.  The methods of embalming are similar to those that were used by the Ancient Egyptians, though fewer mummies remain from the Guanche due to looting and desecration. \n\nTenerife ( ; ] ) is the largest and most populated island of the seven Canary Islands.  It is also the most populated island of Spain, with a land area of 2034.38 km2 and 898,680 inhabitants, 43 percent of the total population of the Canary Islands.  Tenerife is the largest and most populous island of Macaronesia. \n\nWheeling Island is the most populated island in the Ohio River.  It lies within the city of Wheeling in Ohio County, West Virginia, in the United States.  The 2000 census showed a resident population of 3,142 people on the island, which has a land area of 1.514\u00a0km\u00b2 (374 acres).  Neville Island, PA is larger (3.4\u00a0km\u00b2) but has fewer people (1,232). \n\nMactan or Maktan is a densely populated island located a few kilometres (~1 mile) from Cebu Island in the Philippines.  The island is part of Cebu Province and it is divided into Lapu-Lapu City and the municipality of Cordova.  The island is separated from Cebu by the Mactan Channel which is crossed by two bridges: the Marcelo Fernan Bridge and the Mactan-Mandaue Bridge.  The island covers some 65 km2 and is home to some 470,000 people, making it the nation's most densely populated island.  Along with Olango Island Group, the isles are administered as 1 city and a municipality covering 75.25 km2 . \n\n",

The ascent to the Shagai Plateau begins near the entrance to the Khyber Pass from the southeast at Peshawar in what is now Pakistan.  It was the site of a British encampment during the Second Anglo-Afghan War which began in November 1878 when Great Britain, fearful of what it saw as growing Russian influence in Afghanistan, invaded the country from British India.  The first phase of the war ended in May 1879 with the Treaty of Gandamak, which permitted the Afghans to maintain internal sovereignty but forced them to cede control over their foreign policy to the British.  Fighting resumed in September 1879, after an anti-British uprising in Kabul, and finally concluded in September 1880 with the decisive Battle of Kandahar. \n\nThe Emirate of Afghanistan (Pashto: \u062f \u0627\u0641\u063a\u0627\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0645\u0627\u0631\u062a\u200e \"Da Afgh\u0101nist\u0101n Am\u0101rat \") was an emirate between Central Asia and South Asia, which is today's Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.  The emirate emerged from the Durrani Empire, when Dost Mohammed Khan, the founder of the Barakzai dynasty in Kabul, prevailed.  The history of the Emirate was dominated by 'the Great Game' between the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom for supremacy in Central Asia.  This period was characterized by the expansion of European colonial interests in South Asia.  The Emirate of Afghanistan continued the war with the Sikh Empire, which led to the invasion of Afghanistan by British-led Indian forces who completely wiped out the Afghans in 1842 but did not fulfil their initial war objectives.  However, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the British again defeated the Afghans and this time the British took control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs until Emir Amanullah Khan regained them after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed following the Third Anglo-Afghan War. \n\nThe Second Anglo\u2013Afghan War (Pashto: \u062f \u0627\u0641\u063a\u0627\u0646-\u0627\u0646\u06ab\u0631\u06d0\u0632 \u062f\u0648\u064a\u0645\u0647 \u062c\u06ab\u0693\u0647) was a military conflict fought between the British Raj and the Emirate of Afghanistan from 1878 to 1880, when the latter was ruled by Sher Ali Khan of the Barakzai dynasty, the son of former Emir Dost Mohammad Khan.  This was the second time British India invaded Afghanistan.  The war ended after the British emerged victorious against the Afghan rebels and the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives from the Treaty of Gandamak.  Most of the British and Indian soldiers withdrew from Afghanistan.  The Afghan tribes were permitted to maintain internal rule and local customs but they had to cede control of the area's foreign relations to the British, who, in turn, guaranteed the area's freedom from foreign military domination as a buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire. \n\nThe Edict of Amboise also known as the Edict of Pacification, was signed at the Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise on 19 March 1563 by Catherine de' Medici, acting as regent for her son Charles IX of France.  The treaty officially ended the first phase of the French Wars of Religion.  Moreover, the treaty restored peace to France by guaranteeing the Huguenots religious privileges and freedoms. \n\nThe Afghan Civil War fought between 1996 and 2001 was part of the wider War in Afghanistan ongoing since 1978.  In 1996 the Taliban captured the Afghan capital Kabul and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.  The Islamic State of Afghanistan government remained the internationally recognized government of Afghanistan.  The Taliban's Emirate received recognition only from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.  The defense minister of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, Ahmad Shah Massoud, created the United Front (Northern Alliance) in opposition to the Taliban.  The United Front included all Afghan ethnicities: Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Turkmens, some Pashtuns and others.  During the conflict, the Taliban received military support from Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia.  Pakistan militarily intervened in Afghanistan, deploying battalions and regiments of its Frontier Corps and Army against the United Front.  Al Qaeda supported the Taliban with thousands of imported fighters from Pakistan, Arab countries, and Central Asia. <ref name=\"Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph\"> </ref> \n\nThe Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) was a United Nations multistakeholder Working group initiated after the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) first phase Summit in Geneva failed to agree on the future of Internet governance.  The first phase of World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) agreed to continue the dialogue on Internet Governance in the Declaration of Principles and Action Plan adopted on 12 December 2003, to prepare for a decision at the second phase of the WSIS in Tunis during November 2005.  In this regard, the first phase of the Summit requested the United Nations Secretary-General to establish a Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG). \n\nThe Treaty of Gandamak officially ended the first phase of the Second Anglo-Afghan War.  Mohammad Yaqub Khan ceded various frontier areas to Britain while retaining full sovereignty over Afghanistan. \n\nThe 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves included severe heat waves that impacted most of the United States, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, Hong Kong, North Africa and the European continent as a whole, along with parts of Canada, Russia, Indochina, South Korea and Japan during May, June, July, and August 2010.  The first phase of the global heatwaves was caused by a moderate El Ni\u00f1o event, which lasted from June 2009 to May 2010.  The first phase lasted only from April 2010 to June 2010, and caused only moderate above average temperatures in the areas affected.  But it also set new record high temperatures for most of the area affected, in the Northern Hemisphere.  The second phase (the main, and most devastating phase) was caused by a very strong La Ni\u00f1a event, which lasted from June 2010 to June 2011.  According to meteorologists, the 2010\u201311 La Ni\u00f1a event was one of the strongest La Ni\u00f1a events ever observed.  That same La Ni\u00f1a event also had devastating effects in the Eastern states of Australia.  The second phase lasted from June 2010 to October 2010, caused severe heat waves, and multiple record-breaking temperatures.  The heatwaves began on April 2010, when strong anticyclones began to develop, over most of the affected regions, in the Northern Hemisphere.  The heatwaves ended in October 2010, when the powerful anticyclones over most of the affected areas dissipated. \n\nLine 2 is the main north-south line of Suzhou Rail Transit.  The length of first phase is 26.557\u00a0km, among them, 6.57\u00a0km is elevated, 19.146\u00a0km is underground and 0.67\u00a0km is open wide.  The line's first phase started from Suzhou North Railway Station (\u9ad8\u94c1\u82cf\u5dde\u5317\u7ad9) and ended in Baodaiqiao South Station (\u5b9d\u5e26\u6865\u5357\u7ad9) near Baodai Bridge (\u5b9d\u5e26\u6865).  The line goes across five districts of Suzhou, including 22 stations(17 underground, 5 overhead).  The first phase part was started to operation on December 28, 2013. \n\nThe Bukhara operation (1920), was a military conflict fought between the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Young Bukharians against the Emirate of Bukhara.  The war lasted between 28 August and 2 September 1920, ending in the defeat of the Bukhara Emirate, which was instead replaced by the RSFSR controlled Bukharan PSR. \n\n",

The 2012 Los Cabos International Film Festival (formerly Baja International Film Festival) took place November 14\u201317 in Los Cabos, Mexico.  The 2013 Los Cabos International Film Festival took place November 13\u201316 in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.  The 2014 Los Cabos International Film Festival took place November 12\u201316, 2014 in Los Cabos, Mexico.

Held in one of Mexico's premier resort destinations, the festival draws attendees and filmmakers from across Mexico, the United States and around the world. \n\nThe Ra\u010dak massacre ()) or Ra\u010dak operation (Serbian: \u0410\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0420\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043a/Akcija Ra\u010dak ) was the mass killing of 45 Kosovo Albanians that took place in the village of Ra\u010dak () in central Kosovo in January 1999.  The killings were perpetrated by Serbian security forces.  The Serbian government refused to let a war crimes prosecutor visit the site, and maintained that the casualties were all members of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army killed in combat with state security forces. \n\nThe Early-April 1957 tornado outbreak sequence was a deadly tornado outbreak sequence that struck most of the Southern United States from April 2\u20135, 1957.  The outbreak killed at least 21 people across three states and produced at least 72 tornadoes from Texas to Virginia.  The outbreak was most notable due to a tornado that hit a densely populated area of the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metropolitan area, killing 10 people and injuring 200 or more.  The tornado, highly visible for most of its path, was at the time the most observed and best-documented tornado in recorded history; hundreds of people photographed or filmed the F3 tornado as it moved just west of Downtown Dallas.  The film of this tornado is still known for its unusually high quality and sharpness, considering the photography techniques and technology of the 1950s.  Damage from the Dallas tornado reached as high as $4 million (1957 USD).  Besides the famous Dallas tornado, other deadly tornadoes struck portions of Mississippi, Texas, and Oklahoma.  Two F4 tornadoes struck southern Oklahoma on April 2, killing five people.  Three other significant, F2-rated tornadoes that day killed two people in Texas and one more in Oklahoma.  An F3 tornado struck rural Mississippi on April 4, killing one more person.  In addition to confirmed tornadoes, a possible tornado hit Ballard County, Kentucky, on April 3, unroofing homes, destroying a drive-in theater, and uprooting trees.  A loud roaring noise was heard.  Two other brief tornadoes may have hit near Westlake and at Tallulah, Louisiana, late on April 4. \n\nThe Oikos University shooting occurred on April 2, 2012, when a gunman shot at people inside Oikos University, a Korean Christian college in Oakland, California, United States.  Within a few hours, the number of reported fatalities reached seven.  43-year-old One L. Goh, a former student at the school, was taken into custody and identified as the suspect in the shootings.  Along with the California State University, Fullerton massacre, this was the fourth-deadliest university shooting in United States history, after the Virginia Tech massacre, the University of Texas Clock Tower shooting, and the Umpqua Community College shooting, and the eighth-deadliest U.S. school massacre overall.  It is also considered the deadliest mass killing in the city's history. \n\nThe Tezno massacre (Croatian: \"Pokolj u Teznom\" ) was the mass killing of POWs of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) that took place in Tezno near Maribor, after the end of World War II in Yugoslavia.  The killings were perpetrated by units of the Yugoslav Partisans in May 1945, following the Bleiburg repatriations.  Summary executions began on 19 May when first prisoners arrived to the Tezno forest from nearby prison camps and continued until 26 May.

This season premiered on September 1, 2008 and aired until November 24, 2008.  The main twist this season was that every contestant was either a fan of Robinson or was a former contestant on the show \"Paradise Hotel\".  The fan tribe was called \"Tenga\", while the Paradise tribe was called \"Sembilang\".  There were many additional twists this season, the first taking place in episode 1 when all of the contestants were made to take part in an elimination challenge.  Mirja \u00d8stergaard lost the challenge and was immediately eliminated.  The next twist took place in episode 2 when Jan Novaa, who had been voted out in episode one, returned to the game.  The next twist took place in episode 3 when Emil Debski swapped tribes in order to even up the tribe numbers.  In episode 4 a larger tribal swap took place in which Jan Novaa, Mads Jensen, and Michelle Jensen swapped from the Sembilang tribe to the Tenga tribe and Emil Debski, Hilde Austad, Martin Persson, Chiro \"Sido\" Kiarie swapped from the Tenga tribe to the Sembilang tribe.  The next twist came in episode 5 when jokers Laila Neilsen and Nick Zitouni entered the game with Laila joining the Sembilang tribe and Nick joining the Tenga tribe.  In episode 6 an individual challenge took place in which the winner would be allowed to eliminate a player from the opposing tribe.  Haider Mohamad won the challenge and chose to eliminate Sheila Nymann.  Immediately following the merge in episode 7, Haider won the same type of challenge and chose to eliminate Karina Strunge from the game.  The next twist came in episode 10 when contestant Hilde Austad used the \"Talisman\" she had to void any votes cast against her in tribal council.  This led to the elimination of Laila Neilsen who had the second most votes.  When it came time for the final four, the remaining contestants competed in two challenges.  The winners of these challenges would earn the right to eliminate one of the losers.  Emil won the first challenge and chose to eliminate Martin and Daniela won the second challenge and chose to eliminate Emil.  Ultimately, it was Daniela Hansen from Paradise Hotel 2006 who won the season over Robinson fan Hilde Austad by a tiebreaking cointoss after the jury vote ended in a 4-4 tie. \n\n",

        "context": "The Rats were an American garage punk band from Portland, Oregon, formed by Fred Cole previously of the garage rock band, The Lollipop Shoppe.  Cole played guitar and sang, his wife, \"Toody\" played bass and sang, and initially Rod Rat played drums.  Their sound was a raw mix of punk rock with occasional country touches.  Their self-titled debut album appeared on Cole's Whizeagle label in 1980.  Soon after, Rod Rat left the band, though he guested on the 1981 follow-up \"Intermittent Signals\" before his death by suicide.  (Prior to his suicide Rod Rat (aka Rod Hibbert) also played drums in 1980-81 for Portland power pop band Domino Theory).  Sam Henry, formerly of the Wipers, played drums on this LP but left to join another Portland band, Napalm Beach.  Louis Samora was on the drum throne for the 1983 album \"In a Desperate Red\", still on Whizeagle.  Samora left in 1984 to concentrate on his rockabilly band, The Jackals.  The band broke up, but Bill Barker of Profile Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia convinced the band to reunite for a single.  It appeared under the band name The Desperate Edge later in 1984.  Soon after, Cole assembled a country band, Western Front, and he and Toody later reunited in Dead Moon.  The Rats' records have long been out of print and sell for high prices on eBay.  In 2008, Portland's Mississippi Records reissued the first album on vinyl. \n\n\"All Join Hands\" is a song by the British rock band Slade, released in 1984 as the lead single from the band's twelfth studio album \"Rogues Gallery\".  The song was written by lead vocalist Noddy Holder and bassist Jim Lea, and produced by John Punter.  It reached No. 15 in the UK, remaining in the chart for ten weeks. \n\nCrackers \u2013 The Christmas Party Album is a studio/compilation album by the British rock band Slade.  It was released on 18 November 1985 and reached No. 34 in the UK charts.  It was certified Gold by the BPI that same month.  The album was produced by bassist Jim Lea except \"All Join Hands\", \"Do You Believe in Miracles\", \"My Oh My\" and \"Run Runaway\", which were all produced by John Punter.  The album contained a mix of the band's previous hits, some re-recorded songs and a selection of covers. \n\nRise Above is an album by indie rock band Dirty Projectors, released on September 11, 2007.  The album was band leader Dave Longstreth's reinterpretation of Black Flag album \"Damaged\", having not heard it in 15 years.  The album features Longstreth on guitar and vocals, Amber Coffman on vocals and guitar, Brian McOmber on drums, Nat Baldwin on bass, and Susanna Waiche on vocals.  Angel Deradoorian would join the band shortly before the \"Rise Above\" tour on bass and vocals.  This album is the first that presents Dirty Projectors as a fully realized band rather than an individual project of Longstreth. \n\n\"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid\" is a song by American punk rock band the Offspring.  It is the third track on the band's eighth studio album \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" (2008) and was released as the second single from the album on September 4, 2008.  The song had previously impacted radio on August 12.  This is the band's 3rd No.1 single on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart after \"Come Out and Play\" and \"Hit That\".  The song stayed at No. 1 for 11 weeks, making it the longest consecutive run for any Offspring single at No. 1.  \"You're Gonna Go Far, Kid\" is certified Gold by the RIAA; despite this, \"Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace\" has never been certified by the RIAA.  It also reached No. 1 on KROQ's Top 106.7 songs of 2008 countdown list.  It is the band's most successful hit of the 2000s and overall one of the most popular songs by the band.  On the album Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace, it appears as the third track after Trust in You. \n\nJoin Hands is the second studio album by the English post-punk band Siouxsie and the Banshees.  It was released in September 1979 by the record label Polydor.  Upon its release, it was hailed by the British press, including \"Melody Maker\", \"Sounds\", \"NME\" and \"Record Mirror\". \n\nThe Joys of Living 2008\u20132010 is a compilation album by the British rock band Sharks, released 5 April 2011.  It compiles tracks recorded during the band's first two years, including their \"Shallow Waters\" EP (2008), \"Common Grounds\" single (2009), and \"Show of Hands\" EP (2010), along with the new tracks \"Sweet Harness\" and \"The Joys of Living\".  It serves as a debut for the band in the United States, where their prior releases were available only as imports.  The album was released through the band's imprint Velvet Scene, a joint venture with Rise Records.  The band supported the album by touring the United States with Social Distortion and Chuck Ragan in April and May 2011, and by playing the 2011 Warped Tour. \n\n\"Playground Twist\" is a song by English post-punk band Siouxsie and the Banshees.  It was released in 1979 by record Polydor as the sole single from the band's second album, \"Join Hands\" (1979). \n\nJoin the Dots is the second studio album by British psychedelic rock band TOY, released on 9 December 2013 in Europe and the UK (17 December, USA) through Heavenly Recordings.

The first single to be released from the album was \"Join the Dots\", released in October, 2013, as a download and limited hand-stamped seven-inch vinyl.  A limited edition of the album included the EP \"Join the Dubs\" containing five Dub remixes. \n\nThis is the discography of Tom Morello, an American Grammy-award winning rock guitarist most known for his work with the bands Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave, Street Sweeper Social Club and as his folk alter-ego The Nightwatchman.  Morello started playing guitar in the mid 80's in the band Electric Sheep together with future Tool guitarist Adam Jones on bass.  After graduating \"\" from Harvard University in 1986 with a BA in political science, he moved to Los Angeles, where he briefly worked as an aide to Senator Alan Cranston.  Later Adam Jones moved to L.A. as well; Morello introduced Jones and Maynard James Keenan to Danny Carey, who would come to form the band Tool.  In the late 80's Morello was recruited to replace original guitar player Mike Livingston in the rock band Lock Up, in 1986 the band released its only album Something Bitchin' This Way Comes.  In 1991 Morello left Lock Up to start a new band, after being impressed by Zack de la Rocha freestyle rapping he invited him to join his band, he also drafted Brad Wilk who had previously auditioned as a drummer for Lock Up.
